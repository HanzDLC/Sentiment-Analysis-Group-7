"I attempted to board the plane with a small carry on and a back pack like any other flight anywhere but Spirit charged me $100 at the gate for my carry on. I've never had this happen with any other airline anywhere in the world."
"They lost my bag in Fort Lauderdale yesterday on December 18th. It had a bar code and destination on it and as of today the 19th , no one can locate it. Spirit was the only airlines to not have someone at baggage claim. Their customer service is all foreigners who hang up on you. The girl in Columbus told us it was still in fort Lauderdale and laughed. We have a couple thousand dollars of personal items on it. They are inconsiderate and understaffed. It never made it on the plane. Don't do spirit!"
"This airline takes the cake for worse airline possible to fly on. Customer service is trash. I flew from LA to ATL for my brothers funeral then back from ATL to LA and i was over charged (almost $300 for 2 bags) one way and then when i asked questions on my way back, they said i was overcharged but proceeded to charge me $125 plus $99 for my luggage. I also paid for WIFI and flex pass and they didn't even have WIFI and wouldn't let me use my credit for food or drinks on the flight. ATL airport for Spirit is the most unorganized, rude employees I've ever seen. I will never waste my money or time on spirit again!"
"   Awful experience, delayed without any updates, my personal item for three flights didn’t cost me anything then the fourth charged me with a late fee of $99 for my personal item, which is not consistent whatsoever. Employees unhelpful and also rude. "
"The worst airline I have ever had to use. They keep changing flight schedules so you can’t count on them as business travel. I almost lost my job because of this and again it happened. Just getting a customer service rep is near impossible. 2 hrs on hold. Still nothing. Website is useless. The last time I flew Spirit they had to do several attempts to land. It was the scariest experience of my life. Do Not Use Spirit Airlines. They are not safe. They are not dependable, they are not friendly. "
"The worst travel experience of my life. First, our plane was delayed by 2 hours because they ""could not find the pilot"" (how do you lose a pilot, their words, not mine). Then, after our short 2 hour flight to the destination airport, as we are circling the airport to make a landing, the pilot announces that ""one of the airstrips where we were going to land is tore up so we can't land and we are running out of fuel so we have to make an emergency landing at another airport so we can refuel"". First, the airstrip is tore up??  Once we land, the crew finally decides to tell us that we will not be able to leave because the pilot is over his allowed flight miles for the day! They just straight up lied to us before saying we were only going here to refuel so we could fly back. No, we were grounded, stuck in a city 2 hours away from our destination at an airport that Spirit does not fly out of! So once they finally get us off this plane (took them about an hour to do so) we are pretty much left in the airport without anyone telling us what is going on (remember this is not a Spirit airline so there are not Spirit workers here and the airplane crew did not leave the plane with us! we found out later that they were shuttled to a nearby hotel while we cluelessly and aimlessly stumbled around an empty airport at midnight). After a couple hours of sitting in the airport wondering what was going to happen to us, one of the Spirit general managers showed up. He told us that they were going to get our luggage off the plane, and then told us that busses were coming to pick us up. After another couple hours (keep in mind this is all in the middle of the night, it's about 4am at this point) he finally tells us that there are no busses coming! Our two options are: 1) stay in this nightmare scenario and go to a hotel until they could get us a flight out at 10am or 2) do what I should have done when I first landed and buy an Uber to the other airport which is a two hour drive away.  I could have figured that out myself if you all would have just been honest from the start and not jerked us around for hours on end. So, a 2 hour Uber ride later ($130!) I am back at the airport where we were supposed to land and now can finally get my car to drive 3 hours back home at 6am with about 1 hour of sleep. After multiple phone calls and multiples emails, I just keep getting the same , bottled response. ""This flight was not delayed for over 2 hours so we cannot reimburse you but here is a $50 voucher for your next Spirit airlines flight. This voucher will expire in 2 months"". "
"Fly at your own risk. Booking with Spirit would be leaving you to chance. You already have to contend with poor conditions. It is to be expected it is a cheap flight. However, to fly with a lay over flight and to be stranded without any recourse is ludicrous. My family and I fly frequently, and Spirit is by far the worst flight and getting worse. The final, amongst many unfortunate events is, we boarded our departing flight to be left on the tarmac for 3 hours. To finally arrive at our connecting flight with 10 mins to spare. They refused to board us. They told myself and the other passengers to wait for an email of a rescheduled flight. The email said that they would not fly us out until the next day in the afternoon. They also callously included they will not accommodate us with a hotel and this was our only choice. This trip was intended to be a turnaround trip with a return flight already secured. Getting there in the afternoon would be senseless. Spirit refused to remedy the situation. They refused to return us home and said we are responsible for the flight from departure to connecting flight and if we were to get reimbursed it would only be from a portion and is under review if any at all. Everyone of their representatives are cold hearted, as if they had a training on how to execute the worst customer service and to be inhuman. While not fulfilling their one and only job, flying you to and from your destination! "
"Very subtle hostile customer service. It's as if their culture has been bred to be disrespectful to their customers. They're not inviting and appreciative of their customers. It has the appearance that they try to scam you out of every dollar they can by creating situations about baggage to get additional funds. By the time they nickel and dime you, it would been better by paying extra for a ticket with a airline that gives better customer service."
"My issue with this Airline is that they have terrible customer service! Also, you can never trust this Airline! We were traveling a family of four! Two of us had to cancelled it. They issued us travel credit vouchers! Now that I called to use it, they made up a story of a family member used it then canceled that flight too but the credit is not available anymore! It’s nothing but stealing our money!"
"This is by far the worse experience I ever had with Spirit out of all the years I have been flying. On the day of 11-21-23 my flight got delayed by 4 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight in Fl to return home to Cleveland. Therefore, I got stuck at the airport for 14 hours and had to book with another airline company to ensure that I would make it home in time to be with my family. On top of that, I had to call off of work so I missed out on money. This was truly horrible and I will never fly with them again. Please anyone save yourself the headache. I have emailed them regarding this issue and have yet to hear back from them."
"Spirit is the worst. They put the wrong departure time in the app so when I arrived for my flight, the plane had already taken off. They gave no compensation for the extra day, hotel, meals, and rides to the airport that I had to have because of their mistake. I have screen captures of all the wrong information posted on their app as evidence of their incompetence. After 6 months of emails, sending receipts, and asking for resolution, they stopped responding to my emails. "
"I will never fly this airline or recommend it to anyone. Spirit Airline is unprofessional. They canceled the flight less then an hour before departure and didn’t have another flight for two days, unacceptable DO NOT FLY Spirit."
"On November 26 2023 I was supposed to fly from Cartagena to Orlando get to the airport on time the flight was 2:28 pm. Received an email from Spirit Airlines that they delayed the flight till 6pm, then an hour sitting at the airport waiting another email that the flight delayed again till 7:03 pm. Try to get in touch with an agent to see if I can be on an earlier flight she said there was no earlier flight. Also my other flight from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando delayed till Monday morning. Never fly with Spirit again, they don’t care about people have business to attend to all they care is money…."
"The lead flight attendant was great! He made the flight very enjoyable with his personality and professionalism! Would like to be on another Spirit flight with him as the lead again!"
"With Spirit you buy a seat in a plane. That's it. Extra charge for anything. $20 wifi, $100 bag check. No food. No water,  No phone charger. Blaring overhead speakers. Spirit killer. Can't stress it enough. Do not fly Spirit."
"This is the third time my flight delay (caused by Spirit) has turned into an overnight stay for me or my mother as we headed back and forth to my uncle's passing, funeral and celebration of life service and every time a Spirit delay caused us to miss our connection, first from Atlanta to Orange County then to Oakland, then from Atlanta to Vegas to Oakland. In Orange County upwards of 20 people were left stranded when a Spirit pilot elected to taxi away from the gate rather than wait for a number of passengers heading to the Bay Area to board the plane. We literally had to beg the airline to provide us reservations since the missed connection left us stuck there for nearly 24 hours. I missed my connection because Spirit delay causing me and about a dozen others to miss the connection to Oakland. This time Spirit refused to provide us with hotel accommodations or even meal vouchers - we were on our own for the next 15 hours or so. Now tonight my 84-year old mother experienced the same thing. Her flight left five hours late from Atlanta. Rather than be considered a no-show she caught the flight and will arrive in Vegas at 1:30am in the morning and won't leave until 5:30pm tonight. Also no hotel, but this time they present a $20 food voucher (which at an airport buys not much). Mind you, bad weather has never been an issue in these case...this is about Spirit's inability to schedule correctly. So as I said - unless you have a lot of extra time to get where you're going and $$$ to pay for food and a hotel at unintentional stopovers - I would avoid this airline at all costs."
"Scales not accurate, at kiosk said bag over by double, over weight fee $125 additional to fee already paid (extortion?). Said don’t let it ruin trip to see daughter. Tried to pay, didn’t work. Checking bag have to make line regardless. Make line. Bag not over, less than half of weight scaled previous. Then the delay starts, seats are horrible, this is board with vinyl on it. Now on way back check in smooth. Now starts new delay, could have spent another day with daughter. Once and never again, will pay extra for less hassle and stress. Maybe you need a new COO. or at least ops manager! Shame."
"Stuck for 1 hr 30 mins in the plane after landing for gate availability and then the jet bridge not working. The worst airlines as how they operate at low costs having less gates and inexperienced ground staff. Will never consider flying them again."
"Spirit Airline, (S-pirate) low cost airline who hides the bigger cost. Be aware to read and check the information about the fee of this airline, I had a bad experience with them. I checked in online through their app and website, the fee for check in bag is $49 and all processes went through without charging my debit card so I wanted to make sure all was good, I went to the Kiosk to double check and they were going to charge me $89 which is double the price. One staff member came over and helped me do the payment through the App again but it did not go through, it said I already modified the ticket! So went to counter service, the staff were not friendly and only pointed out that you must pay $89 at the machine, I tried to describe what happened with their App! The supervisor came to me and pointed out “its up to you if you want to pay or not fly with them”, this is unacceptable they do not train staff to assist customers but force customers to pay through their unworkable system. I will not recommend any travel with Spirit Airlines as you cannot control your budget of traveling, their is a lot of fees and many tactics to suck your money, overall its not a low cost airline but lower profile in aviation industry. "
"I have flown Spirit Airlines on many occasions. I have always had a good experience. The flight attendants and pilots have always been very courteous. Yes, it is true, that they charge for almost everything, however, considering the low fare at certain times it is still a cheaper bargain than other airlines. Their planes are the newest fleet in the industry, they are well maintained and clean. I consider flying on Spirit Airlines to basically be a 2-3 hour bus ride. If people want to pay $450 for the same flight on another airline, just simply to get a little bag of peanuts, then that is their wasteful decision."
"Refused reimbursement for a cancelled flight due to Covid-19 sickness. Three days before the departure of my scheduled Spirit flight, I was diagnosed with Covid-19. I communicated immediately the airline representatives of my decision to cancel my scheduled domestic flight on Sept 1st, by phone and by Chat. The received answer was that I will receive an initial refund, and later I will be contacted by email to provide further proof of my sickness, in order to receive the reimbursement for the cost difference of the cancelled flight. Soon I got an email from them with a support number, and because of their extenuating circumstances, the response by email will be longer than normal, but within 30 days. To be sure of letting them know of my condition at the cancelled flight I answered that email a few days after with the medication label image attached with my name. A few days after the 60 days passed from the cancelled flight, and not getting their email request for providing further proof of my sickness, at my own initiative I provided them my doctor’s certification of my condition at the time of the canceled departure. Their answer was that my request was denied because I didn’t answer their email sent to me a month later, containing the request for the documentation of my medical condition at the time of my canceled flight. In fact I didn’t receive that email at all. Even if it could have been lost in my Spam folder, which was highly unlikely, still the medication label I sent them very early was clearly confirmed by my doctor certification letter which I provided them later. After al these, despite of the fact that I proved my condition at the time of the flight by both documents, they still maintained their denial. I could easily board the flight in my sick condition without being noticed by the flight personnel. I suggest anyone to consider my experience when thinks about booking a Spirit airline flight. Still, even if I didn’t get the full reimbursement, I definitely do not regret cancelling that flight for the sake of the other passengers"
"The worst flying experience ever. Rude staff, tiny seats, outrageous carry on $$ and expensive snacks and/or drinks. The flight to Boston resulted in a 45 minute delay on the tarmac. The flight to Charlotte was delayed 3 times and as a result I spent 5 hours at Logan airport. I will never again fly Spirit just to save a few dollars which you really don't because of the fees for everything! Just an overall bad experience."
"When booking through a third party website like Priceline there is no indication that the customer will be charged a $100 fee for a carry on bag. They don’t tell you about that until you get to the gate. The only other option the customer service agent gave me was to leave my bag at the airport where it would be disposed of. Spirit airlines is actively scamming customers and presenting themselves as a low-cost airline while charging exorbitant hidden fees. Pay a little extra and use a real airline."
"I paid for two two seats and an extra fee for them to be together. My wife didn't make the flight they resold her seat and refused to refund me. They also changed the  flight time from 6:45 to 6:00 with no notification causing me to almost miss the flight. On top of that they lost my luggage."
"Was not properly notified of connecting flight gate change and terminal change and I missed it. No announcement by flight attendants, no announcement placed at the gate, no page. Tried to seek help from Spirit staff to no avail. Was directed to the check in desk and it was empty. Happened to find an agent but she told me she was about to go home and directed me to call the customer service number. Called it and they directed me back to the desk because they don't have access to booking flights and no one at the desk! Then directed me to some live chat thing and the result was..my issue will be resolved in 30-60 days!!l So in summary, I was left stranded in the airport with no flight home, no way to find lodging, not even an offer to cover food! I found an American Airlines flight for the next morning which cost me an arm, and a half day's work lost. I also paid for my own hotel and food. It's not worth your time or sanity and they don't even care!"
"A mistake on their end cost me 2 days of my non-refundable vacation, 4 hours of paid-for rides to/from the airport, and $500 additional to catch the next flight. I spent hours and hours trying to get this issue resolved both over the phone, and on their bot chat system on the website. I was not offered any sort of compensation or solution. The most you will receive after a painstakingly long conversation with a robot is ""we are so sorry to hear your less than satisfactory experience"""
"At 4am we checked our suitcases and the attendant was disrespectful, she didn’t care at all that we had spent the night on a chair. She threw our suitcases like trash right in front of us, like she was mad for something. The management of this company is awful and their employees are a reflection of it. They don’t care at all about customer, they only do their job for the salary. If I can control it I’ll never flight with Spirit again."
"
Spirit Airlines is not worth your time. It may seem cheaper, but they employ all manner of receptive tactics to recoup their apparent lost margins. The employees are rude and the lines are unreliable. Expect delays and a generally negative experience."
"The max weight for a checked bag is 40 lbs on Spirit opposed to everyone else that allow 50lbs. I have never met such arrogant gate agents as the people who work for Spirit. If you have the misfortune of asking a question they will ignore you for the first 10 minutes and tell you they will tell you when they are ready to answer a simple question. We were given flight vouchers after they over charged us for a previous flight but when we attempted to use them we were told they were useless and couldn't be used. The agent didn't know why they gave us a 100$ voucher, the most you could ever use is 15$ and they can only be used once. If we could give 0 stars it would be far more accurate."
"My luggage was damaged (only my 2nd trip with it). I found an attendant within 5 minutes of getting my bag and showed them the damage. They gave me a yellow card and for me to go on the website later. This was at about 12:30 a.m. I went on the website later and they claimed I was not timely and rejected my claim. I reached out via live chat and I was given 2 phone numbers one that did not apply and automated and the other rang for 16 minutes then hung up on their end. I had to repeat myself several times in the chat asking for actual help and they gave me a response that's how we keep our prices low and terminated the chat. I spent over 1 1/2 hours for nothing to be resolved. There is no real customer service available."
"One of the worst flights I've ever had the displeasure of getting on. The aircraft itself was loud and seemed outdated. Staff were okay but the worst of it was the heat. The cabin was near 83-84 degrees which made the 4 hour flight absolutely miserable."
"Spirit Airline is lower than 3rd world airlines in service and quality. This Airline is unbelievable low standard, and irresponsible, in every area from their airplane to their service. I was traveling from Atlanta to LA. There was an extra mechanical noise in the cabin throughout the flight. I had to change my airplane in Las Vegas and I had my boarding pass for gate 15. They changed the gate without sending message or an announcement when I landed in Vegas. I had only 10 minutes to get to the new gate and I lost my flight because gate 15 counter was busy and no any sign or person to let me know that the gate is changed. Their employees are not trained properly and nobody give you a clear solution. They gave me their customer service number and customer service wants me to talk to Spirit people in the gate by the time I finished talking to customer service no body was anymore on the gate. I had to stay in the airport for extra day and fly to Burbank instead of LAX. Never Again"
"The most horrible airline. I will never use this airline in my life. 12 hours delayed and you have to pay for your personal items."
"This airline has the worst business model possible, putting always profit over anything else, particularly customer experience. I fly with them every few years, always forgetting how bad the experience is, and leaving the flight feeling dissatisfied and highly disappointed. A member of the crew just told me they’re like all the other airlines, this is just not true. Spirit has the worst service of any American airline!"
"We have been sitting in the Newark Airport for 6+ hours because of a tire issue. A flight after us also had a tire issue, then they fixed and loaded the 2nd flight 1st. No compensation was offered. If I could give this airline a negative 10 I would. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again."
"Spirit Airlines is not worth trying. I wish I had listened to the people who warned me against booking through them. I arrived (after a 2 hour drive from home) to the airport at 4:00 am to catch my 5:45 am flight. All the passengers were boarded and then we just sat. Eventually we were told to exit the plane as there were some, “maintenance issues.” They had customers who had connecting flights with a one hour layover come to the front desk to discuss what they needed to do (rebook). They told me since I had a two hour delay at my connecting airport that I didn’t need to worry about it. An hour later, I finally went up to the front desk as they were not boarding the flight yet. They said, “we haven’t heard anything” over and over again. Finally we were all notified that the flight was cancelled. I was offered a rebook through them or a refund. This trip was extremely important to me. They just played it off like it meant nothing. In fact, they acted like they were doing me a favor by rebooking. They would only rebook through their airline, and will not put the customer first by looking for the best options. The fees for luggage are more expensive than most, the weight limit for a checked bag is only 40 lbs. You have to pay extra for a carry on. I could go on and on. This company is not worth your hard earned money. "
"Due to impending tropical storm Norma we tried to book flights out of Cabo a day early, Glen was extremely helpful and got us booked out of Cabo to Atlanta. He was very patient and thorough. We really appreciate his efforts. The actual ride was fine, not much leg room and have to pay for drinks but Glen’s customer service was great."
"What a mistake trying Spirit. My 9am flight got moved to 7pm. How do you change a flight by 10 hrs. So I made it 6:30 am and they changed that to 6am. Flight home was all set for 10:40 am mobile checked in and then it got canceled while I was sleeping. No apparent reason given. Weather is fine all along east coast so it wasn't for weather. They are just terrible. Sorry I tried them. Oh and the 40lb bag stuff sucks too. Leg room sucked. The flight itself was surprisingly good. No turbulence good takeoff and landing."
"The only thing that is cheap with this airline is the service and the comfort inside the plane they are using. Traveling from Cartagena to Phoenix, via Fort Lauderdale I was charged twice - $90 and $75 respectively - for 10lbs overweight of my checked baggage (that I had to pay extra for when I bought the ticket), for a total of $180. I was also charged for a seat in the emergency exit row, where there is more leg room, but the seat does not recline.... They seats are thinly upholstered, so that my back hurt when I reached Phoenix after four hours. There is no net to keep a water bottle, snacks, or magazines, no entertainment, and no place to charge your phone. I expressed my frustration over the $180 charge for the overweight bag, to the attendant at the Fort Lauderdale airport, making it very clear that it was the company I was frustrated about, not the attendant. She just shrugged it off, and when I arrived in Phoenix, my bag mysteriously had hot left Fort Lauderdale even though I was two hours early for my flight. There is no lost-baggage desk for Spirit in Phoenix. I was directed to go upstairs to the main check-in, and there was a line of other, very unhappy passengers. One of them, an African American man was crying, saying that he was being laughed at by the attendant. This is where I learned that my bag would not make it to Phoenix until the next day, which meant that I had to change my flight to Page Arizona until later in the day, loosing half a day that I could have spent on my way to Grand Canyon. I will never use this airline again. I ended up paying more for my flight than on American Airlines, which I have used for the same route before. Their marketing is disingenuous, manipulative and their add-ons for overweight luggage are usurious, taking full advantage of the notion that it is very unlikely that a passenger will ditch contents of his/her luggage to avoid paying for overweight. "
"Spirit Airlines is the worst. Cancelling flights last minute. Can’t get ahold of customer service in order to get flights rebooked. We could never get through to customer service, wait times given are the not ones that were promised to us by the apps or the phone lines or texting The group of us all tried to mad rush to rebook or try to rebook a flight that we were not planning on being cancelled. We all tried different methods and We ended up having to go through different airlines."
"This is by far the worst airline ever, it is impossible to check in online, they send you a boarding pass that is not a boarding pass. I sat on hold for an agent for over 45 minutes! Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service. I leave in 12 hours and still cannot check in."
"Spirit decided that they had a schedule change so they change my flight meaning I miss my appointment and the whole reason I’m traveling. They refuse to refund the ticket. Absolutely the worst airline to deal with. Their customer service doesn’t care. This is the absolute worst airline I’ve ever done business with. Pay the extra money and fly on any other airline."
"Less than half of the plane was full, but crew insisted that I pay an upgrade fee just to switch an empty seat, in an empty row of seats, all I got from the crew was a big fat sorry."
"This is without a doubt the worst airline ever. First they charge you almost a full ticket for being 2 lbs over weight with your luggage then they charge you for seats they can’t even give you a complementary glass of water on the flight. Then they changed the gate I was supposed to leave out of didn’t even announce they changed the gate when I asked one of the workers about the flight he couldn’t tell me anything at all then when I finally found out they changed the gate I had to run all the way to the other side of the terminal and still missed the flight. Then they tried to say that it was my fault that I missed the flight and I had to spend the night at the airport because even though they changed the gate without notice they said it was my fault I missed the flight. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy. And I will never fly this airline again. I don’t know how the hell they are still in business as bad as they are."
"In August I booked a total of 12 one way flights from Orlando to Philadelphia for Sunday 8/20 at 3:15. Spirit.com timed out for the first purchase of 9 tickets, and I had to speak to customer service to continue with the booking. I told the gentleman that we only needed 5 checked bags total which was applied to the first traveler. The second booking was done online for 3 travelers and we added only 1 checked bag. Your system added one checked bag for the 8 other travelers on the first booking- so that’s 13 total and for 2 more on the second booking for a total of 3. I did not add those bags- the site did. Spirit overcharged us $645.01 and has cost countless hours on the phone & utilizing the “live chat” text feature. I was told I could only get a credit not a refund even though it was Spirit’s error. That blows my mind. The site is not user friendly; I’ve read many other comments and reviews that match my complaint identically regarding your weak technology. We were in Florida for an untimely death in the family and the last thing we should have been worried about was getting our family home. Spirit did not make it easy. The first time I was on the phone your supervisor who conveniently disconnected me. I tried to get her back on the phone but could only get a customer care representative- ironic because no one really cares. She said she’d call me back in 20 minutes. Never did I get an email or call from her. I tried to call your corporate office and could not get any person on the phone. This is disgusting. In our darkest hour Spirit Airlines took advantage of a grieving family. I tried calling again and was transferred and no one could help. Finally, I did see my credit was issued. This was the text conversation I had. “Hi! Thank you for contacting Spirit. My name is xxxxx and I will be more than happy to assist you further with your overcharged for checked luggage inquiry. Please allow me a few moments to look at your reservation, gather information, and start working on your request. I do apologize for the wait time. You’ve been issued a reservation credit which is valid for trips booked within 90 days of issuance on any flight dates available in the system. It can be used for multiple bookings until the full value is used and can be applied toward airfare, bags, seats, taxes, and fees. Any Guest linked to the original reservation can use it. Amount: $567.01 Expiration Date: 12 November 2023 I have sent your confirmation to the email you have provided. It may take up to an hour for you to receive this email. If you still are not seeing your confirmation after one hour, please reach back out to us.” It says any guest can use and the total amount is listed. It’s actually $650.00 because we booked 3 more flights separately- a total of 12 flights. Today, 10/1, I tried to use that credit. My husband and I paid for those 12 flights, yet the credits were issued individually. Even though it’s clear we paid, I was unable to use the credit to purchase my airfare. I first spoke with an agent who was unable to help me so transferred me to the loyalty department where I spoke with another staff who informed me the voucher credits could not be transferred to me, the person who paid. I think “loyalty department “ is ironic Imagine if this is happening to others the money spirit is making. I couldn’t reach corporate either. Our flight was no picnic either. Just awful service. Disgusting!"
"I usually support Spirit they are the only non stop flight to Kentucky so I put up with the small seats, no food, and up charge for literally everything but I tell myself you get what you pay for so it’s ok. This time was ridiculous! My bag was over by 2 pounds so I took out my purse which helped. Then I got stopped as boarding the plane because I had two items. My back pack and a purse. They said consolidate or pay. When I consolidated my purse into backpack it did not fit their size requirements so they then charged me $99.00 for my empty purse. I will never fly Spirit again, they are the worst in every way."
"Spirit airlines is merely just a way to get from point a to B. Nothing good or special about it. Seats were terrible. And the tray tables,   I could barely fit my hand on it. Windows were dirty, very dirty. And the landing was not good. But they did provide food and snacks that were decent which is a upside. But I had to innovate to find something to prop my phone up on which I did (only use for the tray table basically). But at least I got to my destination."
"I was charged 3 xs for the same bag as I could not get clarification on purchase or not for my bag. Their check-in process sucks online for baggage. Make sure your bags to do not exceed weight limit after you already purchased prior bag weight limit (to save cost on baggage as their website states)as they will not refund your money of prior purchase. Make sure you get a receipt as they charge you even though I did not get a receipt when they said I had. Poor customer service. You have to purchase food and drink on the plane. Seats small (and I am a small person). No one will call you back, they just blame on the next person you should have talked to at the airport, not when you leave! I have never had any problems with any other airlines! Please fly anyone other than this airline because they could not care less about their customers! I have reached out to my credit card company as well to dispute charges!"
"The worst airline ever. The personal at Oakland airport was super aggressive with us. They were yelling to me and my mom. The entry from gate to plane was absolutely terrible. Never choose this airline. The worst service ever."
"What horrible service at the check in. The guy at the head of the entrance was abusive to everyone who walked passed him because, even though there was no sign saying that the beginning of the line was not actually the beginning of the line, everyone took the beginning of the line as such. When I called him out for being abusive towards a woman who did not speak English he threatened me. Look how there were several people just trying to check their bags (we all paid a lot of money to do so) and how only one person checking bags. It was horrible and abusive treatment not customer service."
"The first half of my non-stop roundtrip flight was canceled due to alleged mechanical difficulties. Instead of my nonstop flight to ATL, Spirit automatically transferred me to their next available flight which was leaving at 9pm arriving the following day in Baltimore, Maryland and arriving in Atlanta that night, after a 6-hr layover, which was after the time that my daughter was supposed to pick me up from the airport and then we were going to drive to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. So, just so you know, I got to the airport 56 miles from where I live. Unfortunately, I did not get the email notification, which must have come a day or so earlier. I work full time and had reserved round trip airfare 2 weeks prior. I didn't receive the email. In any case, I got to the LAX parking for the week I had requested off and got on the shuttle to the airport where I went to confirm my flight and at that point noticed on the Spirit app that my flight was going to Baltimore Maryland. So I called customer service and they said oh that was a layover and that I would be arriving in Atlanta at some point I don't know 9:00 pm the following night and that was too late for me because we were driving to the Myrtle Beach from ATL for a presentation that was going to be happening midday. So customer service rescheduled me to the best they could do. It was going to already be a 6-hour drive to Myrtle Beach from Atlanta with non-stop roundtrip airfare. So now I am faced with a four hour delay to leave LAX, a 6-hour layover in Baltimore plus the 6-hour drive to help my daughter drive to Myrtle Beach for her presentation. I didn't really have any other options. I tried to get a fight to Myrtle Beach, but that was going to also arrive in Myrtle Beach after the presentation was over. I would not recommend Spirit Airlines. Spend an extra $100-$200 and fly with another airline. Many have all-inclusive fees anyway. I understand it may seem like more. But you want customer service if something goes wrong after the 24-hour grace period before your flight leaves. A text message would have sufficed. "
"We had booked with Spirit to go to Mexico on 9/22-24/23, when I arrived at airport at 5:45am, I was told they changed our flight without contacting me! Then the attendant says there were no other flights available. Then we are told to check with Southwest and United for a ticket. We will never deal with Spirit ever! Now my birthday trip was ruined!"
"Hands down the worst flying experience I have ever experienced. Flight was diverted due to a storm and because we were running low on fuel. We were told we needed to divert to refuel, but then all of a sudden the slight crew had reached the maximum amount of time that they could work for the day and we were told to deplane. From there, we experience a total of 6 flights delays and were stuck at the diverted airport for 7 hours. We did not take off from the diverted airport until 2 in the morning. We experienced another delay once they finally boarded us after 7 + hours of delay, only to sit on the runway for another hour. There was zero communication from the airline during the 7 + hour ordeal. This airline is inefficient, understaffed, and a hot mess. I would never book through Spirit again. Pick another airline."
"They flirted half the plane to pay extra for bags causing a delay. I’ve flown with spirit many times and have never had a problem. Customer service was rude, plane was dirty, overall just very unprofessional. They then force you to pay $99 to pay for your bag. Never flying this airline again."
"The single worst experience in my life. One second I'm boarding then the next I'm back in the lobby with a 3 hour delay which would make me miss my connecting flight. And the resolution i was told was there's nothing we can do but give you a refund or get you a flight the next day. Lost a day on hotel reservations and not to mention wedding plans got delayed. I Should have gone with my gut feeling and never bought from spirit. A complete wasn't of time. And the customer service help desk was incompetent."
"To begin with originally booked a direct flight with Spirit from Orlando to Las Vegas for 19th September. Booked this months ago and was cancelled and altered 4 times up until the day of departure. In the end it was changed to a stopover flight in Houston with a 40 minute wait in Houston. Sounded OK. We boarded the flight at gate 86 and were seated for a 4.26pm departure, when at 4.15 the captain comes out and said they have an engineering problem and we all needed to leave the plane and they will find an alternative. Eventually we were told a new plane would fly us at 6.00 pm from terminal 91.This is what happened, leaving at 6.26.We arrive at Houston stranded, along with other passengers who were travelling to Las Vegas as well. No further flights to Las Vegas available when we arrived at 8pm. We go to the service desk who told us because the flight was delayed due to Weather, we have no recourse. Rang their customer service who implied we were lying about these events. Refused to give us accommodation. On their records it was a weather issue. Amazing this conclusion, as it’s not often you change planes because of weather! Quite unbelievable a company operates like this and couldn’t even tell on their computer that planes were replaced."
"This is the only direct flight to Pittsburgh from LA and I travel here as often as I can to visit my grandparents. I am so happy to fly Spirit because on top of no layover, the customer service is great. This particular flight has been my best experience so far, although there was a delay, the on board team got us boarded and taking off allowing the pilot to get us back on schedule. The team, Kitty, Keyy, Marilyn and Angel were so personable and friendly. "
"Worst service, starting from the counter personal and their machines (which are confusing and I'm not bad with technology) scanners takes forever, they had to help every single person in line because their scanners are useless, women helping was rude and bossy. Attendants were ok but still bossy, no free snacks, it's not like they are the cheapest, they are bad but not cheap and they charge $95 per bag. Seats are so uncomfortable, (but I'll give this, their leg space is much better that others airlines). Overall this is the worst airline out there and laws should regulate mire this aspect."
"This was the second time flying Spirit. The first time I wasn't a fan. Gave them another try and completely changed my mind. The crew was so nice Daniel and Pamala were awesome. This is the first time I didn't want to get off the plane. Crew can make or break a flight. These 2 deserve some recognition. Thank you for a very enjoyable flight."
"Even the cheapest, bucket European airline is way better then this. I wish I had know about what they were like, as I would never have flown with them. 6 hour flight, no charging, no hot food, seats are terrible."
"Flying Spirit will cost you more than higher quality airlines in the end. Tried to add checked bag on line for days prior to flight. Continuously received ""Oops, something went wrong. Try again"". Note everything else on app was working fine. Had to check bag upon arrival to airport which was $20 higher than online ($60 online/$89 at airport). Couldn't get help reducing that cost even though issue was with Spirit's system. - Lower bag weight minimum than quality airlines which means they can add additional ""overweight"" baggage fees. Another $125. - We paid $214 to check one bag. Now the cost of the ""cheaper"" flight was more than a high quality airline! - You have to pay for in flight water, drinks, snacks. Again, would have been better and cheaper to book on a high quality airline where you don't have to pay for these. While waiting in line to check bags, all 3 Spirit clerks were tied up with travelers having issues. They did not move them aside while they got these worked out to keep line moving. One clerk allowed family to check bags and then waited for other family members to arrive at the airport and jump up front to check their bags. Then they all had to empty and rearrange bags to help with weight. No in-flight entertainment or free Wifi for entertainment on app like other airlines. Yep, you guessed it, you have to pay extra for that! Flight attendant spent nearly 20 minutes ""selling"" Spirit and a Spirit credit card. Passengers had to sit and listen to this person go on and on and on. - Seats were in terrible shape - ripped, faded, etc."
"My flight departing from FLL (NK1966) was delayed in FLL for over an hour. We had to sit on the plane until we were able to take off. The only consolation that we got for our trouble was room temperature water in a cup. I was due to arrive in DFW at 11.30pm central time but did not arrive till after 1.30am central. On my return flight the very next day back to FLL from DFW scheduled to leave at 2:38pm central did not actually leave until 3.45 central and again nothing for my trouble. When we arrived at FLL we had to wait on the plane for about 20 minutes until they could pull up to the terminal and again, nothing for my trouble. This was the most horrible experience, and I will never fly with you all again!"
"The flight was a disaster. The crazy started at the boarding gate. The employees were rude and unprofessional. They overcharged for everything even a personal bag. I have never felt so disrespected like that before. Spirit needs to do better and treat the customers with respect. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy."
"Bought 2 tickets on-line with kiwi.com paying CAD$193.34 with the agreement that up to 7 kg of personal items are allowed to carry without any cost. But Spirit charged US$178 for the hand carry which was less than 7 kg; and now kiwi says I never request or paid for the baggage. I forwarded my receipts that was charged by Spirit to kiwi. Both kiwi and Spirit cheated us by proving us a cheaper ticket in one hand and charging us unreasonably very very high amount just to carry a small hand carry of less than 7 kg which supposed to absolutely free as per the kiwi at the time of booking. So, never buy air ticket from kiwi.com and never fly with Spirit Airlines. The same bag was allowed for free for the same tickets in connecting Westjet flight from Phonix to Calgary."
"The customer service is terrible! When we were doing the check in the lady was very unpleasant and didn’t even offer a hello! She was not enjoying her job at all. Started making a hard time for the person that was in front of us, the customer had an issue and instead of see how could she help she said you are not going to take this flight!  After we got to the boarding gate, the lady at the gate started saying I had to pay for my hand bag, I said why if this are the measurements online, and I purchased my bag with the measurements, and she said, it has to fit there, I put it inside the measurement bin and put it vertical so a little bit was coming out, it was literally a little bit and she said is $90 that is not going to fit! And I repeated that I bought it with the measurements that spirit have on the website. I put it horizontal and was perfect, she really wanted to charge the $90, the person behind his bag fitted perfectly and just the upper hanger was a little out and she made him pay $90 or lose the flight. Never going to fly with this airline again."
"Horrible experience. I arrived 4 hours early because I felt like they were going to do something negative. First my bag weighed 57lb which I understand that 16 lb over. So I removed quite a few things. Then I went to your front desk and it said 56 lb like I only remove one pound of things and I had a whole huge bag in my hand. So I remove more. Then it weighed 47 lb I removed seven more pounds and weighed all the stuff that I removed and it was quite over the amount that it was told to me removed. But the scale said I was still 1 lb over but they let allowed back to pass. Which it's all nonsense to even have a 40 lb and then you have to pay $125 overage totally unacceptable policies.  This is not the first time I've had a problem with spirit. Enough of spirit airlines nonsense. Not just baggage but delays and all the other issues."
"Absolutely the worst airline ever! You think you're saving money, but when they get done with all their little charges, you'll pay the price of a first class with all the perks on any other airline! Not to mention being forced to pay 100.00 to check my carry-on, which has been permanently lost with no offer to compensate me for the fee or my personal belongings. Don't fall in their trap, you're not saving anything!"
"This worst experience I’ve ever had flying with any airlines I’ve flown with before. To start off I had to pay $168 to check in my luggage. Which was more than what I spent on my airfare. Next, the plane was late coming to the airport and delayed taking off as well. After landing at Orlando to get on my connector flight, we sat on the tarmac for approximately 45 minutes waiting to off load. By the time I exited my flight, my connector flIght had taken off, I stood in line for an hour and an half waiting to talk to customer service. She informed me the next plane available to my destination wasn’t available for another 24 hours. I asked if I may have a voucher to get a hotel. She said the best they can do is give me a 10% off coupon for any hotel room in the area. That didn’t help me one bit so I went to retrieve my checked luggage to see that it wasn’t at the carousel. I walked over to Spirit lost baggage department and I was told that it should be waiting for me in Arizona. Next day I arrived in Arizona and no luggage! I’ve been on the phone, email, and text messaging with the airlines and Nothing!  The airline refuse to give me a refund on my luggage and guess that I won’t get any compensation my personal belongings!"
"They boarded us on the plane at 9PM. Once we were boarded they told us the pilots for this plane were having difficulties with the plane they're flying in from. They gave us no other information. We ended up being held on the plane for 2.5 hours before taking off. The flight itself was only 2 hours. We were not only not offered any water or light snacks, they wouldn't even allow us to purchase. We couldn't get off and get them ourselves either because we had no idea when the plane would take off and could miss the flight if we got off the plane. Employees completely lacked empathy and did not care. They acted like they were being inconvenienced that passengers wanted water, all while the employees were drinking water and snacks they brought and laughing with each other. If this weren't being the only direct flight into Atlantic City near my family, would never use this airline."
"I didn't actually fly with Spirit, I just wanted to ask and complain. I canceled my flight 30 days before I was scheduled to leave and didn't realize I wouldn't get a full refund. They gave me a ticket voucher for 1/2 of the original cost and only 90 days to use it. I won't be able to fly in 90 days."
"Worst airline ever, flight was to leave at 7.36pm, at 9.11pm we are still sitting in the runway. We have been giving vague reasons why we are here, the staff don't seem to care. I spent $76 on my ticket and another $64 to have a carry on bag to miss my event. This is just horrible, the delay is longer than the flight. "
"Despite the ridiculous wait time, they charge for everything - wifi, bags,snacks. That's not even the most ridiculous, getting on flight there was a 30 min delay, going back home 2 hours talking about its a maintenance issue. I won't ever use this airline again!"
"While all airlines are dealing with employee shortages (particularly pilots), supply chain challenges, and grumpy passengers who stood in TSA security lines for an hour, Spirit increases the stress level by trying to make more money with having passengers bid for a seat with inadequate leg room."
"I was Originally scheduled to fly from Cancun to New Orleans on a direct/Nonstop flight.  My direct flight was cancelled and replaced with another flight through Fort Lauderdale with a 4 hour layover. The flight from Fort Lauderdale was delayed 3 times.  None of the spirit staff showed interest in my inconvenience and none of them were willing to help. As a result of all this my 2 hour flight turned into a 14 hour trip, impacting my arrival time which affected some business that I needed to take care of on Saturday. When I arrived it would be too late to conclude my business and I was not able to complete my business on Sunday since it is a day off for most people. This is my first and last time flying Spirit airlines."
"Flew to Vegas via Delta. Trip was great! Customer service was excellent and the price was great. We had comfortable seats, check in bags only cost $30, seats were $28 each, on flight movie, complimentary beverages, everything went smoothly. Jump ahead to trying to get our flight back to Minnesota. Rude employees at the desk, we couldn't get the bag tags to print and the person whose job it was to help appeared to be busy doing something else, we had to pay an extra $79 per bag for 2 of the bags, and the rude employee behind the desk was so busy talking and being rude that by the time we went to check our bags at the self serve counter, we had missed our flight and was not allowed to board! I asked for the manager and a rude woman who stated she was the ""supervisor "" came out and acted like we were irrelevant! On top of that the next flight they had was for the next day at 2pm Saturday and stated we would also had to pay an additional $99 per person (3 of us) for them accommodating us?, the flight we missed was at 4.30pm Friday. We will never, ever, fly Spirit again and I suggest the same for anyone reading this. They are overpriced, rude, no empathy, unapologetic, and a miserable bunch of employees. Aren't these jobs customer centered? The customer's are the reason they have a job and can pay their bills and take care of their families. Spirits reviews are so horrible, I would be surprised if they lasted another 2 years. I really hope they don't. I think Delta and Sun Country have mastered what customer service is and do not price gouge."
"Ft Lauderdale to Freeport. Spirit Airlines has rude flight attendants and everything is money. Carry on $89 beverages $4 Only accommodation is free air. I will never fly with them again."
"Something always goes wrong with this airline. Today it was a mechanical something. Delayed takeoff by an hour. Shameful that this airline so often has issues."
"This airline stressed me and my family the heck out. Horrible customer service, we booked a flight from LA to Orlando and had no problems until we were at the Orlando flight for spirit to go to Boston. The spirit workers are rude, especially one girl at the counter who kept stopping us because we couldn’t bring our shoulder bag along with our luggage. We even had bags that held food from airport near our gate and she STOPPED us and said we couldn’t board unless it’s stuffed in our luggage/backpacks. The rules are so inconsistent because we were able pass the first flight without issues. There were only 10 minutes for our flight and yet she was rude, yelled, harassed and even threatened to close the door gate just because we were trying to follow her rules by putting our bags into our luggage. After a good few minutes of that she then began to tell every single one of my family members to measure the luggage/bags to see if they fit while knowing we only had a few minutes to board. There was 8 of us and we managed to get in on time except for one because of the horrible customer service. No friendly staff. And we had to pay an extra 200 dollars for two luggage’s that “weren’t acceptable”, we are getting it refunded anyways because it’s stupid. All that just for the flight to be uncomfortable, no free beverages or snacks (better off buying it outside the plane), 20 dollar wifi, and some rude flight attendants. Never again will me and my family go to spirit."
"Worst airline I have ever flown with! Our flight was cancelled three months before our departure. We were never notified. When we arrived for our return flight home from vacation they gave us the bad news. Spirit offered to book a flight out for us the next day for an additional $2000! The money we spent buying the original ticket could only be used as a credit on Spirit Airlines - no refund to use with a different airline. We lost our direct flight home and needed taxi for 8 people and two hotel rooms to spend the night. After putting up a good battle the supervisor waived the additional $2000 fee but would not compensate us for the taxi and hotel rooms - after all, they did us a favor by waiving the additional fee. Talk about gaslighting and making the airline look like the “victim”. We will never fly Spirit again no matter how good a deal it is."
"First of all they broke down my luggage lock in LAX while I even didn't lock my luggage. I didn't know I can file a claim about that. Then the flight was very poor and horrible from LAX to DC. The seats were very uncomfortable for such that long distance flight. For sure it was my last time traveling with Spirit Airlines."
"Our flight form Cleveland got delayed 5 times. It was almost an hour away when they completely cancelled. Of course, by that time we had our bags checked and went through security. I have 4 little kids so imagine the whole experience. They lied and said that Miami airport is closed but in fact Miami airport was still open and many flights arrived there after our flights. Then we waited in line and got nothing but a refund without considering our hotel and car reservations. I called and chatted with their representatives, the worst ever. Very rude and hung up on us many times. The last time they offered us a credit as a compensation but then didn't process it. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Of course, our very last time flying with this poor airline. Cheap for a reason!"
"Terrible. Horrible. Supervisors and managers have very poor customer service. Believe all the bad reviews that were put here because this is the worst airline so far. First time booking with them and i regretted it. This airline will just take your money. Don’t even consider flying with them because of the cheap tickets because i swear you will end up paying more like triple once the flight will have a problem. No vouchers. They put me and my kids in so much stress. Please save yourself from any hassle and stress and just do not book any flights with them. Take note! They charge everything, from your baggage, seats, and even water. No complimentary services offered. Will surely never fly with them."
"Aside from the normal poor reviews that Spirit gets, I have one to add on a recent experience that has solidified their loss of my future business. I booked a flight a few weeks in advance that would arrive at my destination by 10:40pm. It seemed that I wouldn't have any issues even with a slight delay. However, on the day of the flight, 1.5 hours before the scheduled departure, I was notified of a 5 hour delay. I made every attempt to find another flight that would arrive before 2am (already an inconvenient time). However, all other scheduled flights to my destination had already departed. I contacted representatives at the airport and online to which I was informed I could be refunded but also cancel my flight. This was not an option as I needed to keep the flight to make an early morning interview. They would not offer anything to make it right. I will not be flying with Spirit at any point in the future due to this experience."
"Horrible service. Worst layover times and on top of that delays for a little drizzle. Worst flight I’ve ever been on. Seats were intolerable. Management has no answers about why there are delays after delays and no idea when we will take off. Wasted my first day in Florida. Cant wait to never fly Spirit again. Flight attendants were top tier. Thanks for your service. Did I mention there’s no free peanuts? Theyre just selling food and WATER."
"My special needs sister travels from her home in Las Vegas to visit me in San Antonio every year for about the last 15 years. For some reason, our mother chose Spirit this time instead of Southwest. It is our routine to escort her directly to the gate so she won't get lost in the airport, and have someone meet her on the other side at the gate. She is fully capable of traveling by herself with these provisos. We always make sure the airline knows that someone will be meeting her, just as you would do with a minor child. August 10th, 2023, I put her on a flight, and luckily, I stayed in the waiting area to make sure the plane took off OK. Next thing I know, they are bringing my sister back out. They had kicked her off the flight because ""they didn't want to take responsibility for her"". They said she'd done nothing wrong, but the captain didn't want her on the flight. I hate to think what would have happened had I left the airport! They would have just left her there at the gate, not knowing what to do. We then had to spend an extra $560 for a Southwest flight to get her home. This is not only deplorable, it is illegal. It is a breach of contract, especially when they admitted she was not being disruptive. This treatment of my sister is unconscionable of them!"
"This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. Ever single gate agent chose to harass me about the size of my bag and not being a personal item, despite it fitting in the bin 3x times for every agent that checked. Despite this, they have no system for marking a bag acceptable and because of this I had to tear my bag apart 3x times or pay $100? The stress and hassle from this experience, after 3x connecting flights (spanning 24hrs in the airport) was ridiculous. I will make it a point to never, ever fly Spirit again (even if my life depended on it)."
"Spirit lost my luggage, found it, then it was completely damaged to the point where it cannot be used. I followed all the proper advice I was given to file a claim, and now I'm getting the run-around and was told 3 different things from the customer service number (1-855-728-3555), the baggage claim number (16789732402) and the ticket agents at the Indianapolis airport. I am out hundreds of dollars and I got terrible customer service over the phone. I will never fly Spirit Airlines ever again, I hope someone who cares gets this and can rectify the situation."
"I booked a flight through Priceline for a Spirit Airlines flight. Before flying with them, I made certain my carry-on was within Spirit’s 18 x 14 x 3 size requirements. I took a bag this size. When I got to the gate, I was told pay $99 or I can't take it on. I had to pay. They made no attempt to measure or weight it. I objected immediately, but it was time to board, so I handed the agent my card. The charge was $99. Once on board, our in-flight the flight attendant said I just needed to send pictures to prove the bag size and they (Spirit) will take care of me. Once I arrived home, I took photos of the height, width and depth with rulers clearly in frame to prove the bag size. So far, I have contacted Spirit repeatedly, followed their directions to protest the charge. Frankly, I have found Spirit nearly impossible to deal with. I have tried everything with Spirit, followed their protocol in stating my situation (repeatedly), taken photos of the bag in question proving its size fits within their requirements. They had only responded with auto-generated letters, not addressing the issue other than to send the size requirements — over and over. This continued until today when I was told I had to go through chat. I stated my case, sent the photos, and Spirit responded by calling me a liar, (see attached) stating my bag is not 18 x 14 x 8. Spirit declined to refund of offer credit because of their policy of letting gate per4sonnel make the call. With no rulers or way to measure. They were wrong, they cheated me out of $99, but accepted no responsibility, even after I sent photographic proof the bag was the correct size."
"I went to Orlando from Louisville with Spirit. First of all, the flight was delayed more than an hour. The gate supposed to be closed at 7:30 pm and it opened around 8:30-9 pm. I had a small backpack and a small handbag. There were lots of people with backpacks larger than mine. They told me that I have to pay either for backpack or handbag. I asked them to put them together. They said the flight is delayed and they don't have time to wait for it. Even if I do, it should fit their standard size which mine will not do (how would they know when I haven't done it?) They were so rude and disrespectful. They charged me $100 for a handbag. When I was getting back from Orlando to Louisville, I put my handbag inside of my backpack and I had all same stuff compared to travelling there. The agent saw my backpack and checked it and it was fine! Therefore, it they would have given me time to put them together, there were nothing wrong with my personal item! When I got back, I sent email to Spirit and explained situation and their agents' rude behaviors. After several emails, they still claim that their agents did the right job! "
"Terrible, hour and half late leaving. The captain didn't say anything but we had to wait for a ""hot break"" to cool off. Very rude stewardesses. Why charge $4 for water? You get it for free from everyone else. Never use them again."
"I've flown with almost every airline and carry my pomeranian when I do. I pay 75 round trip with every other airline and spirit charges over 250? This is ridiculous and will never travel with Spirit again!"
"I am 5’3 and it’s sad i feel like a sardine has more room these days. What about larger taller people on the plane? This is creating a hostile environment and people are showing it, just look at the news. We are being made to look like the bad guys when we complain of this injustice from their actions from greed. I paid for my seat and my daughter’s, the man next to her was taking up part of her seat because he didn’t fit in that space. That is not my fault or my problem but the airlines have made it my problem. It’s pretty sad when their pilots come on and ask people not to not fight because of the irritability it’s causing, explaining to people if you’re at the window you get the window and one armrest if you’re at the aisle, you get the aisle and one armrest if you’re in the middle, you get both armrests. Needless to say when my daughter was in the middle, she did not get both armrests. Then have even gone as far as placing a piece of platter over a piece of plastic that isn’t even the width of my finger nail and the seats do not recline. "
"Freaking insanity. We have been hold hostages on the plane for 1 hour 15 mins cuz this airlines doesn’t pay for the gate. First and last time I fly this joke."
"We arrived in Atlanta from Boston waiting for our flight to leave at 6:44 PM, at 1:00 AM in the morning we were still waiting, the personal was hiding behind the gate and no information was given whatsoever, finally at 3:00AM they told us the flight was canceled, to gather our luggage and go through security again, they offered a flight 48 hours later, and our reimbursement was $104, we needed to be home to go to work, we booked our flight with Delta and we spent $500, I had and insurance with Spirit but each time I called them they were playing dumb, at the end I stopped calling because it was exhausting. I don’t understand how can this goes on without anyone protecting us, it is a shame we are let alone, as customers without anybody stepping up for us, incredible!"
"When I arrived to the ticket counter in Charlotte, the first representative was expecting me to know to go to the kiosk to get my bag information and would explain why. He just kept pointing at it rudely. When I tried to check in with my given confirmation number, my information, wasn't providing relevant flight data, so it printed up as me not having a flight/being at the wrong airport. I went back to the counter to speak to yet another rude representative. He said I was going to be charged $25 to use his services. He quickly found my flight information! I asked as to why I would be charged and he said ""Since you don't understand."" He took my bag and apologized for the ""miscommunication"", only after I told him not to speak to me like that. When I arrived in Orlando, my bag did not arrive. My bag never even left Charlotte. I spent the night and an entire day in Orlando on a work trip, with no clothes. Worst flying experience I have had."
"My wife and I booked a flight for Costa Rica last year for our Honey Moon. Unfortunately my wife caught Covid shortly before it was time to leave. We paid for flight insurance in the event something like this occurred. I looked up the qualifications for a full refund and Covid was one of the those reasons. When I called in to give the news and collect my refund, I was rerouted to Expedia where we booked the flight. I spoke to someone at Expedia and they told me no, Spirit is responsible for refunds. So I called back again. Same result. I went back and fourth 3 times before I got fed up and asked to speak to somebody hire up at Spirit. I explained to them that no one is accepting responsibility for who’s in charge of giving the refunds and finally the supervisor agreed that they were. Went through the whole process for getting a refund. And even had a confirmation email stating that we will be refunded within a certain period of time. A couple months went by and I asked my wife if she ever received the refund. She said no. So I called back. And the person I was speaking with said oh your refund was converted over to a credit instead. I asked why. And they said because Covid was not grounds for a refund. I double checked the websites refund policy again and sure enough I was right. Also I asked why wasn’t another email sent out to us informing us that they converted it to a credit? Now a year later I try to claim my credit for my wife’s birthday and they tell me it expired 90 days after. How does a credit of my money expire?."
"I fly quite often to my residence in Indiana from my work location in Orlando. This time around I just needed a one way ticket since I was driving a U-haul up and flying back. I've done this many times with a round trip ticket, but this time I inadvertently click the flight in the wrong order so a ticket from MCO to Indy instead of the other way around. I got on their website and tried to see if there was a remedy of changing the flight. To my dismay they refunded the fare price of $49 as a credit for a future flight that has to be completed within 90 days but did not refund the upgraded seat that cost $100. I realize that if you read the fine print this is what your agree to however, they will sell that seat again and will be out nothing. This flight is 11 days away and it seems to be a very egregious way to treat customers, especially if you want repeat business. I booked a new flight with another carrier and hope to never cross paths with Spirit again."
"Will never fly this airline again. Waited an hour and a half to check in my bags. This is ridiculous, this airline has no consideration for their customers."
"Out of all the different airlines I have been on spirit has been by far the worst! The flights are cheap but wait till you have to pay $200 to check in two bags one a carry on and the other a checked bag. Not only that but on other airlines such as Delta and American it’s only $30 per bag and you get free drinks and snacks unlike spirit where you have to pay $4 for water. In the end it’s worth paying the extra $40-50 for American or delta . Finally every single flight that I have had with Spirit has also been delayed by 45 minutes to and hour and a half."
"I purchased 3 tickets, my Son is staying in Michigan for college but I purchased a return ticket for him by mistake. Money was not refundable, upon calling the airline to explain, I said at least I will have more space on my way back home (you know how uncomfortable this airline seats are). The lady from the airline told me that I had to move because this seat was taken by someone else, I ask who and she said my son name. I said I know but he is not coming, she reply that in that case the seat was going to be given to someone else. I ask for my money back in that case and she told me no. Never flying Spirit again. Delta is only 40 dollars more and they provide an excellent service, also a luggage on Delta is only 30 dollars, Spirit charge 100 dollars, no tv, no recliner seat, no snacks, no nothing"
"Wow Spirit Airlines you are absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. After a 5 hour delay for “weather”, we all get rushed on the plane then told to get off because the aircraft was not able to fly due to damage from the last flight. Their airplane sat there for 3 hours and never once was checked by crew members. Then they proceeded to cancel our flight tonight! No reimbursement, no hotel offer, no rental car offer. Just to rebook for another day they could get you on an open flight! NEVER AGAIN will I use this company. Awful company. Moral of story don’t ever waste your money with this airline!"
"I've never written any reviews on airlines before, but since Spirit Airlines gave me the worst customer service I've ever received from any airline, I was compelled to write a review. Missed my flight to Oakland due to delays, customer service was unable to refund any cost. Understandable, I booked another ticket from LAX and asked if any credit could be transferred. I was refused this request and had to pay an extra premium to take that flight with increased Uber costs as well. On my way back to SNA I did not receive any email/text notifications that my return flight for my round trip has been cancelled. Was told at the check-in desk that was simply ""standard procedure"". Almost missed my flight home but luckily scrambled to the gate. Was told that if I booked a check-in bag on my previous booking I was allowed to take my luggage onto the plane. As I was about to enter a lady walked by and refused to let me onto the plane as I did not check the bag. Did not offer to listen to my explanations at all and forced me to pay an extra 99 dollars and once again told me it's not her problem and it's ""standard procedure"". Told me if I had a problem then go get a refund request. I will never ride on any spirit airline flights for the rest of my life and neither should you."
"The flight to no where. I was booked to fly from Charlotte, North Carolina to Sacramento, CA with a layover in Las Vegas. I was emailed that the flight to Las Vegas was cancelled at 5:45 am for a departure schedule for 8:52 am. Why an email? if Spirit is going cancel last minute, text the cancellation. So I arrive and learned when I tried to check my bags that my flight was cancelled and my only recourse was request a refund, well actually they did offer me the opportunity to book another if I choose that option they would have also give a $25 voucher. I wanted my money back. So I cancelled my reservation. Since it was a round trip flight I assumed that my cancelation for the flight there and back. However now I am getting emails asking me whether I want to check my bags and upgrade seat for the return trip. Spirit you never got to Sacramento, the return flight should have been cancelled when you didn't get me to Sacramento in the first place! I have spent a career as a continual improvement professional I would love to fix Spirit because they need fixing! Lost customer for life!"
"Broken planes, out of wack scheduling and no help from customer service. I feel like I'm being disrespected, and very disappointed."
"Another flight with scheduling issues, did not let anyone know until a few minutes before the plane was supposed to be boarded, drove all the way to the airport just to be told to wait at the new gate for 9 hours till a new plane arrives, had to spend $400 on a new flight instead. Little to no compensation for wasted time, and money. Definitely would not recommend or will be flying with them."
"Worst flight experience ever. They kept delaying flight since 2:00pm till 9:00pm as they said they are waiting for Pilot to arrive and at last they said flight is canceled due to bad weather. Their reason was not at all valid. Didn’t give us any flight in 2 days as they didn’t have any seats available in any of the flights and they don’t give you other airline flights. Didn’t give us any hotel facility to spend the night had to be in airport for refund till 1:00am with kids. They just had one answer we can’t do anything. Outrageous customer service. "
"This airline and its staff are the most incompetent, rude and unhelpful I have ever encountered. First the flight was delayed repeatedly over the course of 7 hours and then they canceled the flight. Got a flight rescheduled for Wednesday evening as they claimed that was the earliest flight and then a few hours later that flight got canceled with no explanation and now there is no flight until Thursday morning. I have never experienced such disorganization. I will NEVER use SPIRT AIRLINES again."
"Spirit is a 0/10 for me! You’d think you’re getting a deal with them because of how cheap the flights are but NO. You have to pay for almost every single bag you bring plus they have the most delays! I had a flight from Tn to Tx but I had to fly to Orlando first, my flight was delayed due to them having to clean the plane for over an hour! Then due to “needing to do paperwork”?!. Which caused me to miss my other flight back home to Texas! Then customer service was so rude! Saying “it was a miss communication” and putting us on a 10:35pm flight! Then 3 hours into waiting, they delayed the flight again  for another hour! Just horrible. Words of advice: think twice before booking a flight with them."
"Two flights for a total of four hour flight time. Neither landing had a gate ready when landed. Total delay for the two flights was almost five hours. They don’t have it together. The perfect example of you get what you pay for. Never again!"
"Save your money. Even if you think you’re saving money with the initial flight prices, they’ll get you with the random and inconsistent baggage fees. Also, expect your flight to be delayed from a few hours to an entire day."
"Spirit Airlines looks very cheap when you book but will become more expensive by the time you get your boarding pass. They charge you $47 for carry on departure and return $67. I flew on July 17 2023 they charged me $111 for carry on which I purchased on line to be cheaper. Later on I modified my flight they charged me $170 and they did not honor my purchase for the original booking. They charged me another $99 for my return flight, so be careful if you fly with this airline."
"Planned a three day trip to Vegas. Flew Spirit out of Detroit. The flight was delayed 9+ hours. Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up ""timed out"". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you! During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight and charged a $69 cancellation fee. I advised them to donate my credit to charity. I will not fly Spirit again. I advise you to reconsider Spirit in favour of an Airline that will treat you with respect. What a disgusting experience both with the flight and the very poor customer service."
"Fed up with Spirit Airlines. I’m writing this review to remind myself never to fly them again. 4 flights out of 4 in the past two weeks either cancelled or delayed. Super hard to have Spirit help with rebooking. Voucher are limited to use only for new flights - not for seats or luggage - so I won’t be using it. Meal voucher expired - just awful. Never again Spirit air. You get what you pay for (or less)."
"When you have a line of people entering a plane all saying, “I will never fly Spirit again,” you know you have a problem. The staff was SO incredibly rude. From check in to boarding, the customer service was abysmal. Our reservation had a carry on and checked bag. At check in, the attendants were determined to make our lives hell. We spent $90 per bag to check in. The attendant told us we could have saved money if we vacuum sealed our clothes inside our bags, and she plans to make a TikTok of tips and tricks to save money on spirit.  Then the same attendants were at boarding. They made me zone 1 and my friend’s ticket zone 4, after we spent $180 to bring our bags with us, and checked in together on the same reservation. We didn’t realize this when we started to board. They allowed some people on one reservation board together, but not us! They pulled my friend out of the line then told her she would need to spend $100 more if she didn’t put her wristlet inside her carry on. While that happened, they told me I wasn’t allowed to wait for her. You think you’re getting a deal. Some info they don’t tell you- a checked bag is 40 lbs, not the usual 50. A carry on is $80 and a checked bag is $89. It is $20 minimum to secure a seat. Extra charge to use the Wi-Fi. No TV’s. No leg room (and I’m 5 feet tall). Never again. I’d rather walk."
"Save your money. Save your time mental space and dignity before every considering giving it to this company. The employees are rude, nonchalant and less than helpful. I personally would rather eat a bowl of fungus toenails for breakfast and wash it down with dirty dish water than ever fly with them again. They are scammers. They broke my bag, intentionally bumped my flight and made me miss my connecting flight and offered zero help or compensation. I was met with deflection and rude employees. Save your money, do not fly spirit"
"I used to like Spirit, because is it easy and cheap way to go everywhere, I’m fine with everything, is a wonderful plane, wonderful way to fly shorts trips, I find myself comfy and I always used Spirit for many destinations. Last trip was 5 days ago, I am really disappointed now with Spirit, I needed to attend my nieces wedding in Florida and my fault I took this plane and unfortunately it was 3 hours delayed. We were waiting and waiting and they were just postponing and postponing the flight, my daughter and me were really mad, we were wasting our time just waiting for them to finally fly to Fort Lauderdale after so long … that’s my complaint, Spirit, please you can do it better."
"First the ladies in front desk are very rude and unhelpful to answer questions. My flights was delayed due to the pilot been tired so we had to wait for 4 hours until another pilot can take the flight. I know that some airlines give you a voucher for meals when this happen the lady on the front told me to call the airline and ask for it and when I call they told me that they don't provide it if is because a weather delay but on the phone they said one thing and in the desk said because the pilot was tired but anyways they didn't give us anything. I have to much to say about the bad service when we were seat already at the airplane they make me change seats because they had to put a wheel chair in my seats I had to leave my three sons alone in the back but the way they ask me for it was very rude. So I will never used this airline anymore. I preferred pay more for a good service. Very bad and horrible service."
"Spirit Airlines take your money and do not offer any options after 24 hours, which I found out after the fact. I attempted to change flights and it was higher than the original flight. I attempted to cancel and would have lost all of my money.  Can you imagine how many people they have done this way and how many millions of dollars they have just taken from people? Life is hard. Circumstances change.  I urge and strongly recommend that you do not fly with Spirit! Changes need to be made with this airline!"
"So far my flight from Milwaukee to Orlando has been canceled going and returning. The agents are very little help. It’s the worst flying experience I have ever had. "
"Dregs of the airlines! Every time I get suckered in with their low rate, I vow to never fly with these incompetents again. $4 for water or coffee. Seats feel like you're sitting on a 2x4. Rip-off for anything extra. Baggage claim taking over 30 minutes!"
"The booking date is 6/27/2023. We were thinking of changing the travel plan but we were not sure. So, on 7/12/2023, one of us used the spirit app to check the terms and payment deduction detail of cancellation because we want to decide whether to cancel or change or just keep it in order protect my benefits. In the app, she clicked the button ""modify my trip"", i.e., cancel or change my trip. It then led her to the cancel button. But she didn't expect after clicking this, the app switched to the website and after uploading a while it cancelled my flights directly and automatically without providing us with the terms and results and the payment detail. Then it led her back to my app, our trip information is all gone. And after the system cancelled our reservation without getting our permission, later the spirit sent an email to Jingyao Li who paid the tickets with a form of money deduction detail and a 10-dollar voucher. How dare they to do this without mentioning us about the fee detail and results in the app and when it switched to the cancellation processing on the website. We have spent 394.54 dollars, but in the end, we are forced to be given a 10-dollar voucher for future Spirit trip. If we were informed that we cannot get refund and the payment detail of cancellation when clicking the button in the app, we would have not used to app to click it. The Spirit company has the obligation to notice the customers about the fee detail and terms agreement option when they click cancel button to let them know the detail not just cancelling directly and automatically without customer's permission. Besides, there are three of us. The app didn't provide us with the chance to decide whether to keep it or more changes but directly switched to the website and cancelled all of our reservation. It was crazy and unbelievable. we tried hard immediately to contact with the staff, but they said the website showed flights were cancelled and they can do nothing for us. So, what's the point of asking the staff for help if everything the company relies on is the non-customer friendly website and tricky app. Due to their refusal of any help about our case, we have to rebook and reschedule our trip. Our request is that Spirit gives us full refunds of this payment fee $394.54. We were very disappointed because we got nothing, no flights, no service and no help. They used their system bug to try to pass the buck and got our money. We have nerve seen such an unreliable airline company."
"Spirit Airlines canceled my flight home from Las Vegas to STL 20 minutes before we were supposed to depart. After paying $303 for my luggage ($89 for a carry on, $89 + $178 for a checked bag over 40lbs.), I waited hours for my flight only to be canceled just a few minutes before. At the ticket counter, after waiting an hour, they could not get me a flight to St. Louis for two days! Also, I would not be accommodated for these two days meaning no hotel, food, or car reimbursement. The only thing they did for me was switch my flight to Chicago (not even close to my destination) and that flight was still the next day and, again, was not my destination. Spirit could not get me home even though that’s what I paid for. I spent almost 24 hours at the Vegas airport, had to go through security three times, and pay $550 total in baggage fees. I’ve never had such a horrible experience with any airline in my life. Please, do not fly with Spirit. It is simply not worth it. I am an inner city, tier-1, art teacher who works two jobs and barely makes enough to pay rent. These baggage costs and inconveniences are a huge expense for me. Not only was I disheartened, I felt like I was completely and utterly scammed. I also felt like there was absolutely no care taken in trying to get each passenger an alternative flight. I mean, I won’t even be making it back home to STL. I’ll be in Chicago. Then it’s on me to find a way home."
"Arrived 2 hours hours early for flight. Paid for 3 check in bags. One was for a minor. Waited in a “self service” bag check in for 30 min. Get to counter, could not check minor bag here, told to go to ticket agent. Wait again 30 minutes, get to front and an agent yells out last call for Orlando, anyone going to Orlando? So I yell yep and step out of line with my family (again this is simply to check in one paid for bag for a minor). A new line evidently forms for Orlando and everyone from the back gets to the front of this line. I’m standing there, confused and annoyed because now the agent is telling me I have to go to the end of the new “Orlando” line. I said I’ve waited in two lines already and the agent said “You can’t just butt in front of everyone” and so humiliating! I said oh no, I waited in this line all the way up. As I stood there, a different agent letting other people go in front of us, and we are now bumping up against our boarding. I told the agent “we are going to miss our flight” and he said “all of these people are going to Orlando as well, you have to get in this line at the end.” My husband took over as I was about to pull a full blown scene. Never again, I would rather connect 3x than fly this airline ever again."
"Canceled our flight after waiting 5 hours due to no pilot then the Orlando staff was rude to everyone had zero accommodations cost us a extra $2000 tried booking us 3 days away from our original flight. I understand things happened but the way I was treated and talked to was unexpectedly"
"Spirit is a good airline as long as you follow the rules! But sometimes people want to make their own rules and that why is a lots of issues with this airline! No airline is perfect! All of them got meltdowns! The only different sometimes is the compensation! But can anybody expect a great compensation when paying sometimes as low as 25 dollars each way? As course not! So I think Spirit do a great job most of the time!"
"They literally force you to pay $99 even if your backpack was a quarter of an inch sticking out from the size bin. They were very rude throughout the whole process. A couple from our flight was not allowed to board the plane because the wife got frustrated and started yelling at the lady who was very rude to her. I will never fly Spirit airlines. Pls if you dont want to get scammed, dont fly with this airline. You are better off paying a little more for a ticket because in the end, when all their charges add up for every little thing they can think of, you will end up paying more and the customer service sucks. "
"This is a warning to anyone tempted by the low fairs Spirit Airlines offer.  You pay an initial low fare, but the additional fees for everything will make the flight much more expensive than taking another airline. If your bag is a couple pounds over 40 lbs, $90 extra. Do you want to make sure your family sits together? $15 additional per seat. We paid around $200 for our checked luggage, then had to pay an additional $90 because my bag was 45 lbs. Their max is 40. Lines took forever and we got stuck in security. We made it to the gate while the door was still opened, but they shut it with us standing there boarding passes in hand. They didn't care. ""Sorry, you'll have to rebook"". No more available flights to Ft. Lauderdale that day which means we were going to miss our cruise ship. Meanwhile, our luggage was on the plane without us on it's way to Ft. Lauderdale. Thanks to Southwest, we found a flight to make our ship, but we couldn't get anyone from Spirit on the phone in Ft. Lauderdale to see about getting our luggage which was only 30 minutes away from the port. No one answered, no one cared. We made our cruise, but without our luggage. I contacted Spirit Airlines when we got back and explained the situation. "
"3 friends and I planned to fly from Boston to Santo Domingo on June 22nd via Orlando and had the most horrible experience. Flight NK2086 from Boston to Orlando was delayed by about 2 hours, and although we asked ground staff and stewards on the plane to communicate with the plane in Orlando so they could wait for us, they ignored our requests. When we landed in Orlando and got out of the plane (after it was delayed another 20 or so minutes because the gate was occupied), I heard an announcement that boarding would close for the SDQ flight in 1 minute. I sprinted to the next gate followed by at least 8 others trying to make our connection, only to find the ground staff at the gate to close the door as we arrived. We were then told to go to the counter to rebook our flight. It was at least a 1hr wait in line because there were so many stranded Spirit passengers from various flights, and by the time it was our turn, the alternative flight we had seen online was already full. The staff told the 4 of us we were already rebooked for the same flight the next day, meaning a 24 hour wait. Since we didn't have that time and didn't want to be stuck at the airport for 24 hours, we asked to be refunded for the missed flight and our bag fees. I asked if they would cover our hotel (and potentially meals) since we would have to stay overnight at the airport (especially if we would have gone with the offered alternative of waiting 24 hrs). They said no, I asked if we should sleep on the ground and they said yes. We ended up booking a flight with a different carrier that left early morning, still forcing us to spend the night at the airport and no sleep. Plus losing a night at the AirBnB that I paid for in Santo Domingo. Besides this horrible customer service and no compensation for the whole situation, on the way back it got worse. One of my 3 friends already planned to go back to Boston on Tuesday June 27 instead of Thursday June 29, but with the same flights. When he arrived at the airport, he found that the staff had canceled the entire rest of the reservation instead of just the one leg of flight we missed. Even though he had his flights in the Spirit app in his itinerary the entire time up to when he got to the airport. So he ended up being stuck at the airport for another night and having to book at his own expense another flight (very expensive last minute), and it took him a total of 2,5 days to make it back to Boston. The rest of us didn't want to be in this situation and ended up booking another flight since we didn't trust the app, because it had still shown the reservation for him as well. When confronting Spirit about all of this mess and the extra costs incurred, they took zero accountability for the lack of communication between flights. They refunded a small amount for the missed flight on the way there and gave some travel credit (why would I ever fly with them again), but not for bags ($100 each way!), or any of the expenses incurred with booking new flights, missed time and food/lodging. Most horrible airline ever."
"I and my wife travelled on 9th July from Las Vegas to San Jose. Discourteous in not serving a cup of water: Before boarding, I asked air hostess a cup of water as i wanted to take medicines myself being a senior citizen. She told that flight would take off. No issue. Bur after flight take off, no response from the air hostess. However the male crew was bringing ordered food. Then i told him which was after half an hour take off. Then he arranged cup of water through air hostess. By travelling in Spirit Airlines, even the basic need for water in a cup is denied. . Even after paying 30 dollars for checked in luggage, we were asked to carry the luggage despite our difficulty in carrying it. What is the purpose of collecting baggage charges. Does Spirit airlines has a motive to harass the customers. It is not the cheapest fare alone matters, a minimum travel comfort and courtesy is expected. "
"Planned a three day trip to Vegas. Flew Spirit out of Detroit. The flight was delayed 9+ hours. Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm.

I advise you to reconsider Spirit in favour of an Airline that will treat you with respect"
"I don't know why people doesn't like Spirit, I have travelled many times to different destinations domestic and internationally with the most efficient and economic service. I live in Houston and I can't believe how united can charge 1200usd to fly to Colombia awhile spirit charges just 300usd with better service and punctuality. Thanks to Spirit I have had the opportunity to visit my family more often. Spirit you are the best. "
"My flight was delayed by 3 hours. No real time flight updates throughout the wait. I’m still not sure what the issue was, what I pieced together was we had to wait on another group of people that were late due to international travel then customs. But we should not have to wait. Accommodations should be provided to that group. On top of that since this airline don’t offer anything Free- we should have at least been offered a Free drink of water & snack at least. But nothing. Didn’t get home until 3ish am. I’ve never had this issue with any other airline. You get what you pay for I guess!"
"There are so many things to say about this round trip flight that I cannot go into it all so I will just highlight. Flight info was changed about 5 times in the month before the actual trip which meant having to change my shuttle info from Augusta, GA to Atlanta airport. Atlanta flight was delayed so many hours that I almost missed my flight to San Jose, Costa Rica. I'm 64 yrs old running a full on sprint from Gate 4 to Gate 14, as I hear my name being called over the loud speaker. (And my gate info had been changed to Gate 13 which was incorrect. Flight home was delayed so late that I missed the shuttle from Atlanta to Augusta and lucky for me, the lady sitting next to me with her son, was supposed to be on the same shuttle to Augusta. She had already called her daughter to drive to Atlanta and pick her up. Atl airport is 2 1/2-3 hours from Augusta, she said I could tag along. I was so grateful, I would have had to spend the night in the Atlanta airport, it is after midnight at this time. Last shuttle pick up is 12:00 midnight. My daughter drove from Augusta to meet me about an hour away where they dropped me off. So the shuttle service doesn't give a refund, only a credit to be used within the year. Well, I rarely travel, this was the first flight I had taken in 20 yrs., so I am just out that $70.00. I will never fly Spirit again!"
"My daughter purchased round-trip tickets several weeks before traveling from Newark Airport to Phoenix with Spirit airlines with her two cats. The plane left over 21 minutes earlier than scheduled. She was given replacement tickets, but leaving from Atlantic City instead. She spent the entire night awake at Airport with cats. In a.m. she spent $168.03 on Uber to travel to Atlantic city Airport. When arriving in Phoenix (she had change in Orlando fla.), her 1 piece of luggage that she paid $110 for was lost. She lost the 2 hour ride from my friend because of schedule change. The shuttle doesn't allow cats. She paid another 2 hour Uber ride of $153.56 to get to my home. On her return date, 8 days later, she still hadn't received luggage even though they found it 3 days prior. She requested a refund or re-schedule for return flight (without cats) because she refused to travel without receiving her luggage first. It was refused unless she paid a fee costing MORE than the ticket. The luggage arrived 1 hour 50 minutes prior to departure and I live 2 hours away. They labeled her a ""no-show"", but it was her luggage that was the ""no-show"". She now lost her return ride and incurred a shuttle cost of $50. She had to purchase return ticket with Frontier plus baggage cost. There were many other unnecessary costs due to lost luggage, one example being that she had to pay out of pocket for virtual Dr. visit for emergency script of meds that she was becoming ill to be without. Her Spirit tickets cost $591.36, Uber $321.59, Shuttle $50 etc., etc., etc. Needless to say, she has been ill, overwhelmed, disoriented without clothing changes, meds, and many many other hurdles caused by Spirit. She was traveling to AZ to prep food, hor’dourves, transport necessities and set up at a location for my recently deceased son’s Memorial. I was too ill and was depending on her help. The day was ruined because of complications from this airline. I cannot ever retrieve this day and do-over."
"From the very beginning, everything was smooth. The seats were smaller than expected, though. Being nervous of flying, I have to say that the flight attendants were very professional welcoming and kind with beautiful smiles. Smooth take-off and a  smooth landing! This was from DFW at an early morning flight, July 7, 2023 at 5:45am to Philadelphia; 2 hrs and 45min. Thank you for making our trip enjoyable!"
"I bought the ticket of this airline through a third party ticket agent and less than 3 hours of purchasing the ticket I tried to cancel and Spirit Airline charged me for canceling. The general law requires that all airlines abide by the same rule which says that if you book a ticket and wish to cancel within 24 hours, you are permitted by law to do so without any cancellation fees or charges. They gave me a credit of $149 out of a $354 ticket that I bought and canceled in less than 4 hours.  "
"The worst flight that I had was with Spirit and I don't recommend this for anyone. I had flight in June from BNA to Cancun and from there to another country. I didn't see my bag there and then I went to ask their agent and they filed a claim and told me that I will get my bag in my destination and they confirmed the bag was still in BNA. I went to my destination and spent my vacation and on my return I called them they told me that they don't know about the bag while I got email that they found the bag and they are transferring it to me, I called the agent again and she said the bag was transferred 2 days after my arrival to Cancun and she said I need to go to Cancun to claim my bag. Does this make any sense to anyone to go for your bag to a 3rd country to receive it? and they said they called me and sent my voice message. I didn't get any call from them."
"I cannot emphasize how disgusted I am by this company. They advertise being affordable, and then you have to pay $90 for each check-in bag, and $90 for any carry-on. Absolutely ridiculous, and they are a total scam. I also saw someone in the airport be denied entry into the flight because the “personal luggage” that they had approved when he checked in was being deemed as too large. They weren’t letting him into the flight and said he needed to pay $90 to make it a “carry-on”. He went to speak to a manager, and after taking their time and delaying the flight for 45 mins, they expedited the process and quickly shut the doors, and left him behind. Then, after paying all that money, my bag is left behind. I’m livid. Additionally, I’ve never been on some uncomfortable seats in an airplane ever.  I really don’t know how this airline is still standing. They definitely should be shut down. "
"Where do I start? I planned a round trip to Chicago Illinois, and my first flight was cancelled 20 min before boarding time. I had to get a refund and scramble to find a flight the same day. On my return flight back to Portland I had to pay 250 twice for my checked luggage. They don’t even offer free refreshments on the plane. Something needs to drastically change with this company, and quick because they have a bad rep right now for ripping people off."
"My flight got delayed 13 hours and as compensation they gave us $50 vouchers which turned out to be completely useless. They separate their flights by classes and majority of the flights are classes which are ineligible for my voucher. The voucher also only covers part of the flight. They breakdown the flight price by basic fare, taxes, and fees. The voucher only covers the basic fare which is only 70% of the price of the flight. I called them multiple times and they give me awful responses and had no intention to help."
"I will never fly this airline again. I had a death in the family and I called customer service in order to credit my ticket to a future flight. I called first to move my flight and was told that they could not move the flight to the date to a future date and they did not fly to the destination where the Funeral was. They never issued a credit but was told they was a possibility to help because of the death of a family member and I could forgo the chat feature in the App. Yes, I was speaking with someone that told me to text someone else through the app. That’s what I call great customer service. So, I did. During the text chat I explained the death of my family member and they gave their condolences and ask me to send over either a link to the Obituary, the actual Obituary, a death certificate or a doctor’s note. The one I sent was the link to the obituary since the others would take time. It took all of 30 seconds to tell me that I did not meet the policy. I didn’t understand and I asked what did the mean? They said that I bought the ticket after he had died and I explained that I had not yet received word that my family member had died and I was out of the country when I made the reservation and got the word the following morning. Needless to say I didn’t have the patience to text back and forth and explain myself and I asked again can I just receive a credit, i’m not trying to get away with anything, I just want to go to a funeral. So, instead of wasting the dollars that I had spent to go to waste. I decided to fly through MCO and fly to my final destination, where the funeral was. I confirmed my flight and checked in and headed to the airport while reading what I can take onboard with me as a personal item. I have a over night carry on briefcase. On the website it strictly dictates backpack, briefcase, purses, etc; as I walk into the area at the FLL security checkpoint. I am stopped and asked to fit my bag in a make shift square which fit but the wheels prevented the bag going clean through meanwhile there were backpacks people were carrying twice the size of my briefcase. I really don’t get this policy if you cannot enforce all sizes of back fitting in that same square. I paid the $89 bag fee to fly onto my next connecting flight to my final destination to make it to the funeral which really is tomorrow but again because Spirit Airlines has no soul and a terrible policy in the event of a family members death. "
"Do not use this airline thinking you're gonna save money. I paid $500 for my flight and ended up paying $1000 total. I'm not exaggerating and I called to get 100 dollar refund they sent me. An automated system who literally answered me with a dot."
"It cost $100 to check a bag for the most uncomfortable flight I’ve ever been on. I would have been further ahead to ship all my stuff or just fly with another airline. Actually would have saved money I think and any other flight would have given me a bigger better seat, a snack, and a beverage just for flying with them. What a joke"
"Initial take off went very smooth after that it went downhill they landed the plane early only to say there will be delays in loading into a terminal. Waited 2:30 hours to get up to the terminal then we had to wait an additional 30 minutes to get off the plane. After departing went to check my bags only for them to be laid out on the floor and nobody informed us. After collecting one of my bags the other was missing and the lady had an attitude saying they put it on the wrong flight when we checked our bags in together. Overall worst experience would never recommend spirit to my worst enemy"
"I want to thank the Spirit team at San Diego Airport for their excellence and professionalism. Prepared, empathetic, fun and helpful team. They managed to solve my problem with very little time left for boarding, they didn't give up on me, and I was able to arrive on time for an important appointment. Thanks!"
"I want to start with the bag I paid 35$ prior to going into the airport then when I get there they charge me 125.00 for the bag is a total of 155.00 just for a bag more than the ticket I paid to fly. The flight was supposed to leave by 5:35 and we are still here, due to the plain needing gas, we board the plane at 4:40 and now is 7:30 and we still here. My first time taking this airline and this will be my last time. The charge for the bag was ridiculous. I will never take this airline again"
"I've been on plenty of budget flights with Spirit, Frontier, Ryanair, etc. and it's pretty standard to be able to have a bag that just holds your water, gum, and snacks. Apparently not with Spirit Airlines Las Vegas. I was forced to put my beef jerky and gum into my flannel button pockets and stuff my thin bag into my backpack. On top of that the check-in people were bad. Hope it was worth it Spirit Airlines because you just lost a lifelong budget customer."
"I once enjoyed flying with Spirit a handful of years ago but more recently I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed in their service since giving them another shot. Yes the flights are less expensive than others listed but that doesn't include baggage fees and if you eat or drink on your flight. The amount paid for baggage on each flight (including our connection) is enough for another flight or 2, it's outrageous. They also damaged one of our bags and the whole handle to hold it and roll it along is broken off, who knows if they will actually provide a refund for that even though they claim to do so. We called to get that taken care of and were ignored. There were also no power outlets on any of our flights to charge any devices. I have never been more miserable flying than I have been with Spirit this time around. We will never fly with this company again and will encourage others to look elsewhere also."
"First off I’ll start by saying Spirit Airlines is the first airline to ever give me problems, they are understaffed so the line was out of the door and at a stand still for at least an hour then they board my checked luggage on the plane but doesn’t let me board when I missed boarding due to their error with the staff not moving fast enough. Almost 40 people in the Las Vegas airport missed their flights this morning and it’s crazy because they held us liable even though they have 2-3 people at the check in stations to service over 75-100 people that were in line. I will never FLY fly Spirit again."
"Sunday 18, I scheduled a 9:37 am flight to Las Vegas but we couldn't board because a flight attendant was coming from a different flight. This wait was 2 hours. Coming back, Friday 12am we leave on time at 6:45pm but couldn't get off the plane until there was an open gate. The pilot explained this would take 25 mins but it was an hour after we landed. Finally got off the plane at 1:30am. I will never book a flight with Spirit Airlines again."
"I think it's unfair that customers aren't able to change their flights without paying $120 dollars. I accidentally booked a flight for Spirit for the wrong days and I don't think it's fair that they can't change the booking for free. It was a mistake. Most other airlines let you change the booking for free or charge a small fee. "
"This is the worst airline ever, my flight was delayed, the they put us in the plane to tell me an hour later that I need it to get out, then 6 hours later and still here and don’t even know what is the problem with my plane because they keep saying they are doing maintenance and do not give any other information. I am at the airport and I do not know if I am gonna be able to catch this flight today, this is the worst experience ever."
"This is a first for me writing a review as I’m very understanding of circumstances that are controllable and not controllable. I’ve worked in the Airline industry before actually as a Transportation manager for a catering company that actually serviced Spirit Airlines out of LAX. This was my 1st time actually flying on Spirit and I had my reservations about doing so, just based on the reputation but I placed my faith in believing my experience would be different. Yesterday I arrive at LAX for my flight to San Juan Puerto Rico about 2 hours prior to departure. I head to kiosk to print my boarding passes, and when I put in my confirmation #. I received a message that I’m checking in too early and my flight is scheduled to leave tomorrow - please see an agent. So then I must stand in this line to get to an agent for over an hour. I learned my connecting flight to Detroit was cancelled. When I finally got the counter the agent told me that my next flight out is in 2 days. My trip was from Monday to Friday now this issue has caused me to lose 3 days out of my trip and if I flew out Wednesday night I basically would turn right back around. I was looking forward to this 1st time trip to Puerto Rico but it looks like that has been delayed. The only options I had was to take the flight change or refund. Obviously I had to do the refund as I was losing on my reserved hotel room that I had for this 2 days, and honestly there was no way I was going to go through the nightmare of getting home. I cut my loses and then proceeded with a refund. As much as I had planned and anticipated the trip all the joy was lost. At the time I’m writing this I should have already landed and been taking in the island but since my vacation was canceled I returned back to work for a vacation I had planned for months. Next step is waiting for my full refund. When I initially purchased the tickets it wasn’t about the price of the ticket but the time of the flights that fit well with my schedule. Spirit mostly likely will not be that option for me in the future."
"I never knew that in this time and age, there would be people working in the airline industry without any semblance of professionalism. My husband and I had the worst experience traveling back home to Orlando from Phoenix. The Spirit agents were very unprofessional in relaying to us and other passengers about our delayed flight. The team members all need frequent practical and developmental courses on how to deal with passengers whenever there is a situation involving delays and or flight cancelation. It was as if, passengers affected by these circumstances are not seen as important anymore. The agents and supervisors on schedule during that time were very pompous and inconsiderate towards the passengers being affected. I am greatly disappointed in the way we were treated by those agents working at that particular time and date. It is not my intention to travel with the Spirit Airlines anytime soon!"
"It was my worst experience. I made check in, we passed TSA and 1 hour before boarding they cancel the flight. We have to comeback to terminal A, look for our luggage and try to get help, it took us 1 hour of standing in line for help. Then we got a fight to Atlantic City, we had to pay 300 dollars to get home. It was really bad, we have two kids and were very frustrated. Me and my family advise people to not take this company, they are very unprofessional and the associates are rude."
"I booked my flight for 198$. I have a flight at 12.30pm but delayed multiple times and finally to 6pm. After reaching Atlanta again delayed for 5 hours and then they cancelled the flight. When I went to them and talked. They said they are going give me the full refund. I waited in the airport until 5am and booked a new flight for 200$ on United Airlines. Reached IAD. I received mail from Spirit Airlines saying they are going to refund me only 45$. Initially for the full refund they sent me a receipt. Now they changed their mind and not given a single $ of a refund. I'm a student, I cannot afford more amount and i booked a ticket for 198$ for two way. Now my flight cancelled and i booked on more for 200$ . Total 400$ i paid. I haven't waited this many hours in airport in my life time. They wasted more than 12 hours of my time, my money, I don't even have a proper food and accomodation. The customer service is very worst. Their answers are rude, They are not even caring our pain and not even considering our words. I hate spirit airlines. Please people don't choose Spirit airlines."
"Terrible terrible terrible! They basically left us in the airport without any accommodations and said that our next flight out would be in 2 days from the original date. They’re horrible! Everyone that flew Spirit was left in the airport for dead!"
"The worst. Will make you wait for hours, then cancel your flight. Will not give a refund for the flights or even a flight credit. Needless to say, the additional expenses incurred with hotel/food/Uber/ect was also not considered. They had one person at the rebooking counter and 400 people in line. Avoid if at all possible."
"They cancelled our flight for no reason and didn't even email us to let us know. If I hadn't looked we would have been stranded in the airport. The seats are uncomfortable . Literally worst airline ever. Will not be flying them again!"
"Just friendly warning to any customers. I’m gonna fly with spirit airline do not waste your money and your time you gonna end up with cancelling your flight and you have to stay at the airport for the next day and they do not offer you a hotel room and all the agents don’t know what they’re doing and nobody is interested in helping you out. You have to wait for a supervisor to do anything at all. I spent more than 2 hours at the counter trying to find an alternate flight, and all for nothing. Me, along with around 20 other customers ended up stranded at the airport and the police had to be called."
"Went through the worst experience while trying to leave Houston. Waited (after checking in online) for hours in the line to drop our bags after going through the whole process of self checking our bags then had to wait the entire line anyway to drop the bags (felt like I was doing self checkout at Walmart only to have to wait in the line anyway). The people at the counter couldn’t have cared less how much of an inconvenience it was then about halfway through the line we were told to move aside to let a group through because they were in danger of missing their flight (no fault of ours but we got screwed again anyway). Finally got on the flight then while trying to leave Cabo we were told we were being delayed due to weather although all the other airlines were able to make their flights to the same airport go through. Now our flight that was supposed to leave at 3 now says it’s being delayed until after 9pm. It’s very obvious they’ve cancelled the flight and will be trying to cram us on the next one which at that point will be over crowded and they’ll be asking people to catch the next one as usual. And all the while I’m on hold with “Spirit airlines customer service” if there even really is such a thing. Still waiting for a human to answer the phone. "
"Absolutely the worst experience ever. They were late, very disorganized, over priced on luggage, their self check in is flawed and we ended up having to help, they flew us our of different terminals which created major luggage problems. I will never fly this airline again. Don't waste your time, it's not worth it."
"The airplane was so poorly designed that the plane seats seemed to be intentionally crafted to torture. It was the worst flight experience I have ever had! I will never under any circumstances, purchase another ticket from Spirit Airlines."
"I arrived for check-in about 1 hour and 15 minutes early, and before they charge me for my luggage ($89), and start check-in though an agent they told me that I'm late and there will be no refund. This is what's happened. An assistant next to to the kiosk spent 20 minutes to charge me for the luggage with an assistant of another associate, then told me to see an agent because kiosk will not check-in me. I spent 20-30 minutes on line (I was the 2nd customer) to wait for.my turn, then an agent spent another 20-25 minutes to tell me at the end that I'm late. This was ridiculous and ripoff, unacceptable service. I asked for a full refund so I could fly with other airline. They said: call customer service. So I did. After staying on hold for 15 minutes, I was told that the best they can do is to give a credit for about half the price I paid total. I'm so upset, I have to call my credit card customer service to dispute this pandit ripoff. Such companies should not exist."
"Leaving Texas March 14,2023 (NK857) we experienced a two hour delay because the Spirit computer system was down. No compensation it was business as usual. I booked a flight to Puerto Rico in advance a (Direct flight). 3 months later I find in my (email) they cancelled my flight. So I had to rebook with only connecting flights (layovers) offered. They made it seem like they were doing me a favor by rebooking on a layover flight. Nothing worst than an airline cancelling your flight and then being treated like they're doing you a favor. Then the only way to make a complaint is to write an email to their terrible non-existent customer service. The only way to talk to a Spirit agent is to book flights (to take your money). If they cancel your flight or cause you an inconvenience, then it's email. One-way customer service is not customer service. Now I know one of the reasons why Spirit has a bad reputation."
"Email received at 4:48PM for flight next morning at 9:21AM. How are people suppose to alter important plans within this short time? This was not weather related cancellation. I had appointments in Tampa ""Hi Spirit Guest, While we understand that changes to travel plans are not ideal, we need to notify you of the following change(s) to your flight: • This flight has been cancelled""."
"  The seats were hard, the seats are too small and too close together. Charging for carry on luggage that fits in the overhead, is ridiculous and insane. My ticket was only $165.00 and had to pay that much for my luggage. I will fly Spirit competitors in the future. I will never use this airline again."
"  This airline is a ripoff, the costumer service is the most horrible specially at the gate to check in , when you purchase a ticket with this airline it seems to be a good deal but it’s not. I ended up paying a large amount of money to travel in a atrocious most uncomfortable seat, they don’t give you not even a water as a courtesy. As the airport was packed and I didn’t had much time to catch the fight the agent  changed me twice for my check in bag, first $85 dollars then another $125 for extra 10 pounds. I understand the $125 for over weight but on top of that $85? Is just an insult. So I’ll never travel with this airline again. No one should ."
"  This is the second time this airline has been absolute garbage but this time takes the cake. I have a family emergency I have to fly for. After over 10 hours of multiple delays filled with nonsense, everyone's emotions were triggered but everyone seemed to remain calm and cooperative. we ended up waiting forever in Orlando to get to a gate. Traffic jam. While one attendant was so very nice and kind during the entire flight, another had the audacity to yell at us over the intercom that we were the problem for going to the bathroom and the reason we were waiting. Guess what! The pilot came on before and right after her display of unprofessionalism and stated that we had nowhere to go. "
"I'll skip most of the details because it would be a very long post to explain how bad Spirit screwed up. In short, we paid extra for reserved seats, paid extra for a bag that was over 40 lbs, then ended up missing our flight by maybe seconds. No other flights would get us to our cruise in time. We saved our vacation by finding a Southwest flight that was half the price of Spirit, no extra charges and no delays. I'm now sitting in JetBlue's terminal (same company) and our flight home has been delayed three times so far pushing it back 4 hours. We're also traveling with a 9 year old. I can't warn you this strongly enough. Do not under any circumstances book Spirit or JetBlue! If you already have, it will be worth it to eat the cancelation expenses."
"I travel a lot throughout USA and used multiple airlines. This was the first time using Spirit, and guess what, they surprised me with their eagerness to pocket your money. I always travel with one small luggage and a computer backpack. Nobody charged for 2 piece of luggage. These guys charged me $99 with a big smile on their face."
"Very new plane. Seats were by far the most uncomfortable I've ever flown. And I've flown a lot. I'm average height 5’11” and 170 lbs not big or fat and my knees were very tight in seat. Plastic seats with almost no cushions plastic armrest with no padding no recline at all. And it was a new plane. Carry on bag over $70. I put them on my no fly list"
"They were listed as the cheapest of all the flights only to find out later that they charge outrageous baggage fees. I'm extremely angry, as I thought I was getting a good deal to find out It was a bait and switch. $89 per bag for only 40lbs and $69 per carry-on is just ridiculous. Buyer beware when you think your getting the best deal check the baggage rates because they get you on the back-end!"
"Horrible customer service. I had just turned my bag in at bag drop. I realized I had my lotion in my purse. Asked the attendant to pull my bag. She wouldn't. It was literally on the other side of the counter. I'll never fly this airline again"
"Spirit is just ridiculous. I had one personal item which was a computer bag. They tried to make me pay $99 to check a computer bag. I unpacked a few items, put them on my body and in my bra. Went to my seat, repacked the bag and it fit in the overhead just fine. No problem. I have photos with proof. They make up ways to try to get you to pay the extra fee. I keep saying I will never fly with them again, they keep giving reasons why I should make good on it. I truly hate their airline and their customer service sucks. They don’t even deserve a rating of 1 from me."
"Where to begin. Flight was delayed 6 hours. They kept changing the gate and no one was communicating anything in the terminal. The flight crew didn't even know what was going on. Finally landed and it has taken hours for the bags to be removed from the plane. The workers from United Airlines offered to help unload the bags, but Spirit said no thanks and our bags are still on the plane presumably."
"So this is my family and I first and last time flying Spirit. Leaving SAT airport to BWI we were delayed over 3hrs due to “weather” but other flights were fine. Then after staying in Maryland for 6days leaving BWI and going back to SAT we are delayed again over 3hrs so flight was suppose to take off at 9pm it’s pushed to 1:13am. We choose them due to nonstop and picking seats since we have a 8yr old. Should of just spent the little extra for southwest and paid extra to board first to grab seats. Asked around and this is the normal of Spirit flights. Should of done my research better. And Spirit doesn’t off anything for flights being so delayed they don’t care at all. Do not fly Spirit."
"I had a layover from Vegas to Nashville in Fort Lauderdale FL. Unfortunately my flight in Vegas was delayed which caused an absolute nightmare. I ended up missing my connecting flight and having to rebook for a flight going out to Nashville the next morning. I was basically stuck in FLL for 11 hours with no access to my baggage (which had my daily breast cancer medication), no discount or hotel voucher and with miscommunication an agent cancelled my AM flight. I had to pay for my hotel and a different ticket with Southwest Airlines. There was no urgency or help from any spirit employee. Over the course of 5 days after landing in Nashville, I still had no baggage and no medication. I talked to over 10 agents on the phone about how important my baggage was and no one seemed to think it was a big deal. I paid a total of $392 for my baggage to arrive in Nashville and it took 5 days. They will not refund me my baggage costs or what I spent on a new airline or hotel. They gave me a $50 voucher, because that will surely help fight breast cancer and I will surely fly spirit again…. NOT! I knew it was a mistake booking flights with spirit in the beginning, but I didn’t know they would fully dehumanize me and handle this situation beyond the absolute worst. I am not one to leave reviews and can remain calm in bad situations, but this was a whole other level of frustration, disappointment and wasted money. Not only over charging someone fighting cancer but getting them their medications with no sense of care/urgency is disgusting."
"This is the worst airline I've ever flown. They get you by making the tickets the cheapest and overcharging for everything else. They told me my bag was too big to be a carry on so they made me pay an extra $100 and instead of checking it in under the plan they had me bring it on the plane anyways. The staff were rude, I paid almost $500 extra dollars for a $100 ticket. I might as well have just flown a regular decent airline."
"I want to thank Sonja for having such a wonderful spirit. Her service and energy should be the model that all airline personnel should aspire to achieve. Thank you Sonja for making my wife and I trip to Los Angeles a memorable one. God Bless you!"
"  Spirit's whole model is built on deception: low base fares and then pay for everything from bags to seats with your travel mates. Unfortunately, the rest of the industry is reducing service levels to try to compete. Spirit's relationship with their customers reflects that deceptive approach. If you prebuy something like wifi, you might find the plane doesn't have it. And then getting a refund will be, of course, not easy. These guys can be ok if you go in eyes open. But you must treat the low initial fares are the deception that they are."
"This is the worst of the worst, do not waste your money on this airline. You will regret it as I did. The are not reliable at all. The offer “free” cancellation but that is a lie so do not believe it. They charge the same to cancel the flight or to change the flight date. promise you you’re better off spend a few more dollars then wasting them here with SPIRIT airlines."
"Disappointing Experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com. I recently booked a flight for my sound engineer on Spirit Airlines through Expedia.com, and unfortunately, the entire experience left much to be desired. I had planned a trip from San Antonio, Texas to Norfolk over the weekend, which involved four flights due to layovers. However, my disappointment began when Spirit Airlines abruptly canceled the trip on the day of departure at 5:30 am, citing a lack of staff. This lack of preparedness and consideration for their customers time and plans was extremely frustrating. One would expect that in such circumstances, the airline would provide a refund or alternative arrangements for affected passengers. Unfortunately, this was not the case for my return trip. Despite the cancellation being caused by Spirit Airlines, they refused to issue a refund. This kind of inflexibility and lack of accountability is certainly disappointing, especially during these trying times where every penny counts. One of the reasons I had chosen Spirit Airlines was its reputation for affordable fares, but the overall experience has made me question whether the potential savings are worth the frustration and inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of customer support and understanding from the airline only exacerbates the negative experience. Additionally, I want to express my dissatisfaction with Expedia.com, the platform through which I made the booking. While I understand that they act as a middleman between customers and airlines, I expected better assistance and support in such a situation. It would have been helpful if they had intervened on my behalf to secure a refund or explore alternative options. In conclusion, my experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com was highly disappointing. The last-minute cancellation by Spirit Airlines due to staff shortages, coupled with their refusal to provide a refund for the return trip, demonstrates a lack of responsibility and customer-centric approach. I would caution others against booking flights with Spirit Airlines, and I hope that Expedia.com can improve their customer support and advocacy for their users in such situations."
"On my way from Las Vegas to Portland. Spirit last minute cancelled my flight at the gate. They had been having internal IT issues and couldn’t get a flight out Friday June 2nd. They were unable to accommodate my flight until after my return from Portland which would have been pointless. I ended up thankfully booking with Alaska Airlines instead for the next morning. Then when flying home from Portland because I’m seated zone 3 the attendant charged my rolling bag which which is the same size as a duffel bag and charged me 100$. I said well are you going to take my bag to luggage and he said no now you can place on top in the cabinets. He gave me a look like I was an idiot and said man this has been our policy for 15 years, I told him my bag fit and your the first airline to charge to now be able to place my bag on top in the cabinet. This airline is a joke and I will not be flying with them again."
"I wish I had read reviews before purchasing a flight from Spirit Airlines. I thought I was getting a bargain on bringing my bike for $75 round trip. Turns out that was only one way, so it was actually $150 round trip, but that was just the beginning. After multiple gate and time changes, my return flight was cancelled at 2a. I stood in line for 2 plus hours with other people from a total of four cancelled flights. By 430a, I was rebooked on the earliest flight available, the red eye that night. I spent money on a Lyft back to the area of the city that I was familiar with, and was lucky enough by 8a to connect with a friend who let me charge my phone and laptop at their office so I could book a place to shower and nap. If my time itself is not included, I lost $350 on an AirBnB, Lyft rides and meals. If you value my time spent on this endeavor, and I do, add on another $240. Altogether taking a chance on Spirit Airlines cost me an extra $437 (paid for non-existent wifi access on return flight, bike return, extra meals, place to stay and cab/Lyft rides) out of pocket and another minimum $240 in opportunity costs. So not only did I not save money, I spent way more on this Spirit Airlines trip than booking my trip on American Airlines would have cost me. On a positive note, I interacted with over a dozen polite, cheerful and helpful employees of the airline. Two were obnoxiously rude and antagonistic, one so much so that because of her alone I would hesitate to fly with Spirit Airlines again. However they were so many other friendly and helpful employees that deserve a positive review. I hope good things come their way."
"I am effectively implementing a company policy today for it to be prohibited to fly Spirit again for any of the 322 employees that work in my company. 48 minutes to drop off a bag. I had to pay $89 for the small checked in bag (this I knew beforehand) and to my surprise another $99 for my carry on that I was charged at the gate because it was half (1/2) inch to large. Supposedly because it had to fit underneath the seat (which of course went on the top bag compartment). I explained to the lady that this was outrageous (half an inch) and she couldn’t care less. I also told her that I was never going to use Spirit again for any of my employees and she also couldn’t care less. Companies succeed or fail because of their employees. This company will never get my money nor my company’s again and I am in shock that because of half an inch this airline doesn’t care to loose business. I am extremely disappointed."
"  I decided to give another chance to Spirit, but they failed again. Flight was delayed for 2 hours, then we were sitting inside the plane for 1 hour, then they cancelled the flight. No explanations. This company does not care about your time. I had to find another flight, spent the night at the airport (nightmare). While we were waiting inside the plane, someone asked to purchase water or if he could have a cup for water. The flight attendant said no. Then 10 min later one of the luggage crew people came and ask for a bottle of water and the flight attendant gave it to him. It's unbelievable that they don't even provide water to a pay customer whom has been waiting for hours. No WiFi and doesn't have a phone charge outlet. This is the last time i fly with this company."
"I had a flight for 9:25 pm and every 20 minutes our flight was delayed. To the point that at 2:30 am they cancel our flight. To say that they can accommodate us on the flight at 9:25 the next day. With small children and suffering from the wait. It is the first time that I traveled with spirit. And it will be the last. Because I am not going to recommend it nor do I plan to use it again. They don't work. Little empathy.  Tenía vuelo para las 9:25pm y cada 20 minutos nos atrasaban el vuelo. Al punto que a las 2:30 am nos cancelan el vuelo. Para decir que nos pueden acomodar el el vuelo de las 9:25 del peoximo día. Con niños pequeños y sufriendo por la espera. Es la primera vez que viajaba con spirit. Y será la última. Por que no la voy a recomendar ni pienso volver a utilizarla. No sirven. Poca empatía."
"Booked a flight for 3 people with 3 bags. Spirit deleted flight from Reno to Vegas. They offered me a alternative flight at no extra charge. I accepted the alternative flight. Upon arrival at the Reno  airport I was charged again for baggage at the at airport pricing. Spirit attendant at the Reno  airport found no evidence of me booking baggage, even when I produced the email confirmation. When I arrived home and contacted Spirit, they did find the baggage and told me they could only offer me a future credit with Spirit, and not a refund of the baggage they made me pay for twice. I asked for the credit to be put in writing and sent to me and they refused. I believe this is bait and switch tactics."
"Delayed by 2.5 hours. Only one employee working and they delayed the flight by another hour because they had to check every bag size and charge everyone in line. I would rather fly Delta and pay the difference than go through this again."
"Our flight got delayed around 6 hours and they only gave us $30 on compensation. The flight attendants didn't even bat an eye when I tried to ask a question. Horrible in every way."
"Worst airline ever! Don’t be fooled by their prices you get what you pay for, which is poor service! My flight got delayed over 3 hours gave me a connecting flight I wasn’t going to make & they refused to take care of it! They were going to leave me stranded in an airport for almost 8 hours but I decided to cancel instead! They gave me half my $ back. Now I’m waiting on my bag, for over 30 minutes and nothing. A nightmare!"
"This is by far the worst flight experience ever! Starting with delays and bad customer service to over pricing for luggage. $180 for a suitcase and a bag of golf clubs. They really trying to squeeze every penny out of customers. Never flying here again. Nasty customer service from all angles. No one knows how to speak to people."
" Spirit canceled flights from Orlando to New York. I told them I had a baby at home to book me on another flight which was available from American. They were rude and just gave us a flight the next day. No hotel information, though we were waiting hours at the airport. Don’t ever fly Spirit."
"I have never in my life been treated so poorly by an airline. We were supposed to leave Austin by 5:50am and arrive to NYC by 2:30pm. We were stuck in Austin for 5 hours before our flight took off. And then we missed our layover. They rebooked us to a flight that wouldn’t get us to NYC until 1:30am almost 12 hours later than our original booking. Which means the hotel we paid for already, that we would not be able to use today, would be money wasted. I’m explaining how inconveniencing to our travel, time and finances their mistakes were today we were told that all they could do is give us two $50 vouchers that expire in August. Why after a day of being told that my time, money and travel didn’t matter to them would I want to fly with them again. I tried to at least get my money back for the flights to cover the hotel cost we lost out on and they refused. Then I get my boarding passes and our seats aren’t together. Mind you, the two people in front of me asked if they could be moved to sit together and they were accommodated immediately. When explaining, kindly, what sort of day we’ve had due to spirit and asking if I could please sit with my husband and they refused to do it. After explaining that they just did it for the people in front of me, I was rudely denied with attitude and threatened to get kicked off of the plane and put on the next flight. I am so exhausted with dealing with such an unaccommodating and rude airline. Because of Spirit Airlines our very much needed getaway has started out so poorly and I have not felt cared for at all. I will never fly Spirit again and am just so sad with how I have been treated today. I am trying so hard to not let it ruin our trip. I am so discouraged."
"Just before boards l was assisted by ticket agent Samantha for 10am flight May 31 returning to Atlanta GA. Due to leg pain it was imperative for me to upgrade my seat to a larger one. The care and courtesy I received from her was beyond her call of duty and l will never forget her genuine concern in assisting me. So many times as customers we are quick to complain but never stop to say a simple Thankyou! Thanks again Spirit for having such wonderful team members aboard!"
"I’ve flown to Vegas on Spirit twice, the 1st time wasn’t too bad, on time, seats a little cramped but it’s a short flight, baggage did take over an hour to arrive, mean while my driver outside waiting & driving around & around. Everyone laughs or says good luck when I said I was flying Spirit. Baggage weight is lowered to 40 lbs, not typical 50 of other airlines, & $14.00 more for initial bag than say like Delta. They charge you $70.00 for your carry on,  my purse was free, my make up bag around 12 X 9 X 5 inches it was an additional $99.00! It would’ve fit under the seat in front of me with my purse. My flight from SLC to Vegas was $208.89 for a grand total of $37789. I did upgrade my seat and purchased Wi-Fi for grand total of 429.88 (I booked round trip my flight home on Delta was $128.90). So here’s my 2 cents to try and make someone else’s flight better Spirit! Train your customer service with suggestions & pleasantries instead of condescending attitude. Not a single employee was willing to help or find a way to help facilitate any issues. Stop nickel & dimeing, & hidden fees. The baggage fees are ridiculous. "
"I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again. My luggage was lost. No one cared. After many unsuccessful attempts to reach someone, I have not received my luggage YET. My trip was ruined. I hate I ever decided to fly with this airline."
"Flights are cheap but they get you in checked/carry on bags and seating. Not to mention the overpriced snacks and beverages for purchase during the flight. This isn’t even the worst part - their customer service is horrendous. I planned a one day trip to golf with business partners of mine, Spirit never even bothered to load my golf bag onto the plane. I was not given a reason as to why my only checked bag was not loaded. When I expressed my anger with their rep, he called the police on me. I had to cancel my tee time and was not given a refund (had to prepay for the holiday). Upon arriving to the airport to retrieve my bag they had flown overnight, and to check in for my return flight, I was told there was an unknown error while checking me in. I was not given a reason for the error, and the only option they gave me was to refund my return flight and that I should check with other airlines about getting a flight home as there was nothing else they could or would do for me. Spirit has lost me and my families business for as long as they remain in business."
"I got the terminal and asked the staff if I was in the right door. The lady started giving me commands about putting my purse inside my bag pack. I told her I would do later on as I was not even passed the security check. She did not allow me to proceed and forced me to do it. I had to get everything out from my backpack as my passport, driver license and the phone with the App with boarding pass was inside. That is the way you treat people? I assume because the lady though I was stupid or ignorant as she talking to me in Spanish. As soon as I started talking to her in English, she changed her demeanor and kept silence when I told her in English that I can afford to pay the carrion on fee. I will never use this lousy airline. I just wanted to clarify that is the way staff members treat Spanish speaker costumer. If you want to charge money for carrion, do it, but educate your staff and provide implicit bias training to those rude and uneducated employees."
"Had to pay 178 USD for my and my son’s carry on luggage at the airport. This Airline drags you in with interesting ticket prices and then they make you pay for it. So finally not a cheap airline at all. Never knew there where airlines that make you pay for (travel light) carry on luggage. Add to that the absence of any comfort it is by far the worst airline experience. Don’t go there!"
"An attractive price of $90 for a 1 way flight became in a total of $417.99 dollars charging a government cut, bags doubled charged, online and on counter, then closing a total of $417.99 Online when I paid the ticket and extra bag was about $150 for 1 way economy! Spirit airlines They trick you and add more and more charges. I paid double to flight in an uncomfortable chair with a bad service."
"I am a vibrant 78 year old woman and I have travelled internationally for most of my life so I am not easily intimidated by the challenges that air travel can involve. That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, My bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore i asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for the flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you your out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no-one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the system. This trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare. The Department of Transportation needs to do something to end the abusive practices of Spirit Airlines. They claim to be an economical airline but in fact they are a bait and switch business. Avoid them at all costs."
"This is the worst airline I've ever flown with. Cheap, uncomfortable seats, ridiculously overpriced snacks and water bottles, additional charges for carry on bags and to choose your seat, and repeated delays with landing and taking off. The only things keeping me from rating it 0/10 were that the flight attendants were very nice and attentive, and that this website literally won't let me."
"In the beginning, our flight got changed twice, and when we arrived to the airport, we had a lot of complications with getting our luggage onto the plane, delaying our ability to get through TSA in a good amount of time before our flight after this. When we finally arrived to our destination, which was out of the country, my luggage was lost. I went my entire vacation without any of my luggage. I had to buy all new stuff and they still have not been able to find it to this day. I have called customer service over and over and they have no way to help me. they have no way to track the package and you cannot even get an update on the status of where your luggage is. This will be my one and only time ever flying with them. During my flight I also bought a Wi-Fi and it did not even work."
"Baggage weight is lower than other airlines. Returned from Germany and boarded Spirit 34 lbs overweight. 100.00 charge. Charges for everything from inflight everything to Wi-Fi. "
"Supposedly airplane issues, was supposed to leave at 11.30 am, didn't leave to 3.30pm, missed my connection. Stuck in Orlando which is the opposite direction. Only to fly back the next morning. To Myrtle Beach to Boston and my luggage be stuck in Orlando. 48 hours without a change of clothes and no idea what is going on. They nickel and dime you for everything. It's cheaper at first but you get what you pay for. Second they get there money back. Worst flight of my life."
"Worst airline company ever. I've been flying for years and never experienced the incompetence of customer service. They didn't do a proper announcement letting everyone know about gate change. Then they had a time at 6.52pm for departure. I went to check in at 7:30 am day before check in… They had everyone boarded and doors closed. More then 10 people weren’t able to get on. I'll never use spirit again. I had to buy an expensive ticket to Southwest. Worst service. "
"Spirit is the worst airline I've ever flown on by far. They seem cheap but charge you a ton for both a carry on and checked bag, actually making it more expensive than a better airline. For a single flight from Nashville to Philadelphia we were delayed for 8 hours, got on the plane, were told by the crew that the flight was cancelled because they were late and couldn't get additional hours approved. Went to Spirit desk to get rebooked along with the rest of the plane and was told they wouldn't cover a hotel or any food (which is illegal) and then lied and said the reason they couldn't take off was weather related so they wouldn't be obligated to pay as that's ""an Act of God"" so we had to get our own food, Ubers and hotel which cost even more before going to our next flight they gave us (a worse flight too, no longer direct) with no reimbursement in any fashion. We even missed work because of this. That flight is also delayed in Orlando which resulted us not getting home until 3 in the morning with work the next day. There was even a fight at the gate which Spirit employees did nothing about! Don't even try to contact they're customer service either, they were all rude and unhelpful of they answered at all. When I told one of them Spirit's policy was breaking the law by not providing accommodations they said ""Yes, that is correct"". Which I promptly took a screenshot of. Not a single employee was willing to help or find a way to help escalate any of these issues to someone who could do something about it. The only recourse they give you is legal action. This is by far the worse experience I've ever had with not only a plane but a company in general."
"Their staff is rude and unhelpful. They want to keep all your money if you try and cancel. Spirit is by far the worst airline I’ve ever flown with! If you purchase, get insurance because they will not be willing to help you once they already have your money. I reviewed once but and reviewing again because of how terrible their service is!"
"Worst airline company ever. I've been flying for years and never experienced the incompetence of customer service. Flights delayed 3 times. They didn't do a proper announcement letting everyone know about gate change. Then they had a time at 6.30pm for departure. My wife went to check status at 5.15. They had everyone boarded and doors closed. More then 10 people weren’t able to get on. I'll never use spirit again."
"Flight from Pensacola to Orlando was delayed. It made me miss their  connecting flight. I got there and was told it just left and no one was waiting in the terminals. I later got emails about updates on the flight saying it was delayed. Even better, these came after the delayed time. Customer service wont help. I was told to file a complaint we cant do anything. I called the customer service line and that's what I was told. They are doing this to screw people over."
"First flight was randomly changed and we receive an email out of nowhere, completely messing up our schedule from when we land at LA. We had no choice but to accept the new conditions until we found a new, more suitable flight that was available. Next thing you know, it takes my friend 26 hours of chatting with an agent to change our flight to a more suitable one while getting told that it’s our fault for “accepting the new flight changes” when we had no other choice. Fast forward to our flight day, our departure was supposed to be at 8:45 pm with a layover of 44 minutes in Las Vegas. Our flight gets delayed to 9:17 pm but even with the new, delayed departure time, we don’t depart until almost 10:00 pm. Due to this delay, we miss our layover flight, getting rescheduled for 5 am the next morning and having to grab our luggage to check-in again. Take this from me please, no matter what trip you have, if you need to fly Spirit even once, you’re better off canceling the whole trip if you cannot find an alternative."
"I had a round-trip ticket to Atlanta, GA. I flew there on Delta and came back on Spirit. Spirit would not take my carry-on bag meanwhile Delta had no problem with my bag. They told me the cost would be $99 for my bag. I told them they were crazy, so I put my items in my granddaughter's bag and threw my bag away. I told her that Delta gave me no problem her response was that this was not Delta."
"Worst airline ever. Absolutely terrible. Our flight was delayed 2 hours and we were told that our next flight would be delayed as well so we would still make it to our destination. When we made it to Orlando from Richmond, we were told our next flight to New Orleans had already left. None of the staff knew what they were talking about. They sent us on a wild goose chase to book our next flight. Not to mention our bags were lost as well. We waited 2 hours for our bags, we were given no hotel vouchers or anything and had to spend about 15 hours in the airport until our next flight took off. Absolutely ridiculous. Avoid using this airline at all costs. Spending the extra money for Delta is the way to go. At least you’ll know that you will be taken care of."
"Today has been the worst trip ever. My plane was due to depart at 9:40am that was pushed back til 1:30pm. My plane from Orlando to Baltimore left because I was still on the first flight. 8 hours later I'm still sitting in this airport. Spirit doesn't care about the people who keep them in Business. Too many young immature people work for this airline."
"Literally the worst experience of my life, let alone traveling. The flight there was booked months in advance and then was cancelled 7 hours prior to the planes planned departure with no explanation, had to scramble to find a new flight last minute. Customer service wasn't helpful whatsoever. Finally got a plane down, on the way they lost our luggage. Then on our trip back, they held us in the airport for 8 hours, delayed the flight several times. We finally boarded the plane, waited another hour for them just to tell us the pilot couldn’t fly because she was over her 16 hour shift limit, and we had to de-board the plane. Gave us no hotel vouchers, no car rental vouchers, and left us stranded in the airport at midnight with no way home. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $150 and go Delta."
"Right now I'm sitting the Spirit to depart for the Miami and just heard the announcement they don't have a Pilot. Seriously. One of the worst airlines I ever encountered with. Do not use Spirit Airlines ever."
"Always late, they never know what happened, your flight is changed and they don't notify you. The service is horrible, the delay is very long, you pay a lot to carry a small handbag. The ticket price being lower than other companies does not make it worth it because of the problems that this company has - never again"
"Supposed to lift off at 9:05pm. Finally started taxiing at 1:20am, first because they were short staffed, and needed to wait for an attendant to show up, then no one to load luggage, and finally, no one to pull the plane to the runway. One passenger was escorted from the plane by police, and some other passengers left the flight on their own. Some of us have jobs, and families that we need to return to! And in compensation for the delay, all we were offered was a cup of water, a small pack of cookies, and dead cell phones? I've never dealt with an airline that was so poorly staffed and run.  I will say that it seemed it really wasn't the pilot, and the attendants crews fault at all. Hopefully they can find jobs at a real airline. If I could give the company a negative rating I would."
"They overbooked our flight and offered cheap accommodations for people to bow out. Flight is late. I only booked with them because they were the only ones flying to DTW before midnight. We'll plan our vacations around other airlines. We're done with Spirit."
"I am appalled at the customer service that I received. When I arrived in Texas it was noticed that 2 of my wheels were missing off of my suitcase. Mind you, that this was only my 2nd time using the suitcase and because I couldn't provide proof of purchase , my claim was rejected. Their reasoning was that two wheels broken off was regular wear and tear! This Clearly was not regular wear and tear but the neglectful act of their employee not giving a darn about someone else property! So needless to say I am not a satisfied customer!"
"Absolute worst. First we check in but the machine won't create the ticket then we wait in line one hour to get a boarding pass because the flight is overbooked. When we get to the gate the plane is delayed 2 hours then as we board they decide our carry on has to be paid for and charge us. The gate person gives us attitude when we pay and does not hand me back my boarding pass. We had to pay for every little thing."
"This airline is well known as the worst by everyone, sadly I wanted to give them a last chance, me and my wife tried our best to be cool with last minute changes but heading to the airport we got another last minute change, a delay of 2 hours . Once we came to the counter to very friendly ask for options, they explained that was none, and also barely we were able to understand the customer service lady. I bet there are many complaints like this, hope some day this airlines are controlled or regulate to offer a better service."
"I’ve flown spirit in the past and usually it’s an affordable easy way to fly which I have enjoyed up until my most recent flight on May 18th at 6:00pm MCO to BDL. We were sitting on the tarmac for 3 whole hours due to “Bad’ weather when it was perfect outside no clouds or anything. They made us deplane, so we had to go back to the gate. After this we are literally watching other flights take off the tarmac and we are very confused. There is no one at the front desks to help us. A flight attendant comes over and tells us there’s a mechanical failure and we will have to wait. Keep in mind all other airlines (DELTA,SW,ALLEGIANT,ETC.) have flights taking off from the Tarmac this entire time. Finally at 3am Is when the plane took off almost a 9-hour delay!  There were only 2 spirit agents helping 2 out of the 7 total spirit gates. Kids were starving as all places with food closed at 11pm. I missed a business deal worth 2k that same night due to this delay. 2 days later I received a voucher for $50. It is laughable. Next thing I did was give customer service a call to try and get a refund on the tickets. He says that the pilots, attendants, manager reported that it was only a “Brief weather delay”? This is far from the truth and simply a lie. You can ask anyone that was flying spirit that day at MCO after 6pm on May 18th. There was a weather delay for 2 hours. Next, we hear that there is a major mechanical issue with the plane from the spirit lady. 6 hours into the delay the pilots and attendants went home because they were over their hours. Next thing you know there are about 4-500 people communing around 6 spirit gates 7+ hours delayed for flights as there were no pilots or attendants to take us home. I want to like Spirit as I’ve flown with them in the past and it’s been good, but this makes me never want to fly or recommend to my friends/family ever again. I felt bad for the poor 2 ladies who had to endure the mess made by poor leadership and miscommunication. Horror story."
"1 hour delay to Jamaica, two hour delay home. Had to run to other terminal after they had to change . I sit here for over and hour waiting on our baggage. Absolutely the worst airline ever!"
"Really bad service and yes they are cheaper but it’s not worth it because they charge us for a carry on bag $99 each it’s ridiculous first airline that charge us for that. "
"Worst airline ever. It’s almost like they try to be as bad as possible. Everything from check in to flight was a terrible experience. $108 to check a 36.5lb bag. $89 carry on charge. Spirit is the worst airline I have flown on. Spend the extra money with a different airline upfront because spirit will nickle and dime you every chance they get."
"So in gate number 54b the Spirit Airlines employee made us pay for a carry on bag and after that they said they cant take it, you have to take your carry on bag. The thing where i  am mad is that they made us pay for carry on bag like a heavy bag but they can't it from us like a heavy bag."
"My flight was cancelled last min almost missed my cruise. The flight that I was updated to was delayed 3 times, gate changed 3 times, flight was delayed almost 5 hours. Worst experience of my life, will never use this airline again."
"I bought my tickets months in advance thinking oh gosh this is so cheap. Little did I know that it was almost 100$ to take on a carry on bag. If so I would have stuffed my personal item in there but she never gave me the option to do so. I almost wanted to roll my bag back out and leave it. 100$! Are you joking? I’ll make sure not to travel with them again."
"Did not show any care if you were military or not. Would not let me check in with my military ID, and did not help me getting my pre check set up nor with my carry on item. It felt as if they did not care about their military members. "
"Seriously the worst airline I've ever had to deal with. In November I had purchased tickets for my family to go on a vacation meeting up with other family. Spirit canceled our tickets without notification. We showed up to the airport looking like idiots when we weren't able to find our tickets using our confirmation number. Money was wasted on hotels, rental cars, and it was the last opportunity to see my family as I was very pregnant and usable to travel later. Then in February I decided to get one way tickets for my family as to give Spirit another chance however they were very rude at DTT airport and I was in a very long line. I arrived early and was instructed to go check in at the kiosks since we didn't have bags to check in, then they said i was unable to check in because I was ""late"" when I had been there with more than enough time to check in. I'm then instructed to go back in line to check in and by the time I make it to the front of the line I still had 30 minutes until my plane was due to depart. I was told the plane had already left but I was never notified that my plane was going to be leaving early. Then I was instructed to wait on the side to be rebooted. At this point it was 6am and I waited more than an hour to be helped, being told that they could rebook me for a 9:45 PM flight and pay $100 for each ticket. I then filed a claim with my bank to get my money back which I did until Spirit reversed the claim saying I never showed up and refused the use of their service. I then had to go directly through Spirit customer service. I got the run around and transferred to every department until someone finally told me to email them. It took then forever to respond. They asked for my flight details which I provided and it took them over a month to offer me a $50 voucher! The audacity. I will never fly or book or refer Spirit to anyone ever!"
"I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! We cancelled a flight and received a $660 credit. We were informed that all we had to do was call to extend the expiration date on the credit if we weren’t able to use it in time. We were 4 days past the due date, called and they said it could not be extended. How does $660 just vanish into thin air?"
"Horrible, flight delayed 2 hours with no notice. Seats are tortuous. Cannot work, cannot nap. I am afraid that my bags won’t arrive. Trash company. Should be barred from flying."
"Today my connected flight was delayed at fort Lauderdale airport and Spirit delayed my next connection flight so I wouldn't lose my flight. Thank you Spirit Airlines."
"My friend and me get to the airport at 5:39 for boarding at 6:14. We check in and the flight is delayed till 9:30. Nbd we will just get food and drinks then chill until boarding. An hour later it delays again, not we won't arrive in Florida till 11:30pm, & again it delays. We are now looking at arriving in Florida after 2am. Our short weekend trip got shorter than it already was. Finally, they cancelled it completely due to ""maintenance"". It took all that time to figure out that this flight wasn't going to leave to Florida at all? We are two single moms with two kids each and could not rebook due to already having made arrangements for our kids and our jobs. We were not able to do this again as it was already hard. We worked overtime at work to afford it and took a loss of 400$ due to no refunds for things we planned to do in Florida, rental card, other non refundable fees and deposits. Neither of us making over 1,700 a month so this was a big loss in our eyes and felt Spirit airlines was at fault and should accommodate for these things!"
"This is the last time we fly with Spirit and will ensure to let friends and family know not to fly with them as well. We arrived at the Denver airport over an hour before our flight was set to take off. We were told the gate was closed and were not allowed to check in our bags as they said they could no longer check us in. After telling us this the spirit employee at the ticket counter moved on to the next customer without even asking if they could help us get on to the next flight. We were left at the counter trying to find out next flight out without assistance from Spirit at all. We ended up taking a flight with United instead with zero reimbursement from Spirit even though they wouldn’t let us on. On our return trip we go the the ticket counter in Ft. Lauderdale to check our bag in and were informed that our bag weighed too much and needed to remove items otherwise would have to pay $99. After we took our bag off the scale was still showing there was weight on the scale when there was in fact nothing on it. We made sure there zeroed the scale before putting out bag back on and the guy rudely asked did you even take anything out of this bag you are still way over. I informed him yes we took a lot out and he said well there needs to be more taken out or it will be an additional $99. We again made him zero his scale and then we were allowed to check it in. Spirit airlines seems to try and get extra money from its passengers due to their scales being extremely far off and employees not really giving any concern about it. When we finally got to the gate there was a spirit employee who was rudely marking people with small bags check the size of their bags and if she didn’t like the way it fit she was charging them an additional $99 for a carrying on bag. She would make sure most women with purses were charged $99 for their purse if they couldn’t fit it in their personal item while allowing others to bring Fannie packs and other bags and not charging them. Once on board we were boarded late and then waited over an hour for the pilot to show up at all. Once he showed up they did not offer passengers any type of inflight beverage or snack for the inconvenience rather charged full price for these items. As some people missed a flight or had to book additional hotels because of the delay you would think spirit would have at least given complimentary beverage or snacks onboard to be considerate and compassionate to its customers"
"This is my last time that I fly with spirit. No seats comfortable, not able to charge phone, no beverages like coffee, water or some snacks, and they charge 89 for bag. So expensive, I'll never fly with Spirit anymore."
"My mother in-law was scheduled for a flight on Mother’s Day at 1.30 pm. We paid a premium to get her home at this time so that she can attend a doctor’s appointments on Monday, May 15th. She waited on the plane for 4 hours and nobody could give an explanation as to why they couldn’t take off. They finally exited the plane and we’re told that it’s “broken” and there’s a fuel issue. They said they would send a voucher for her to get something to eat. She never got it while waiting to see if the issue could get resolved. 5.5 hours later, finally stated that they’ll have to book her on a flight for tomorrow. They lost her luggage. She’s hysterically crying and now my wife is waiting for her at the airport for over an hour because they said that they’re “too busy” to look for it. We will never book a Spirit flight again and hope that none of you will either. Customer Service is absolutely awful!"
"Worst experience ever. From checking in to getting into the plane. Rude customer service everywhere. Cheap flights? Not really checked bag we paid for had a limit of 40lbs. We had 57 pounds and had to pay extra $125. On our flight back from Atlanta to Dallas we had to buy a carry on to save a few $$. Next time we rather spend a little more money and have a pleasant experience. This whole Spirit experience is a complete nightmare."
"Looks cheap but actually not. Customers should pay almost everything such as seat, water and baggage. Narrow, uncomfortable seats without charging ports. Unskilled staff. Changed gate at the last moment. Not only my flight, but happened multiple other flights nearby my gate. My impression was, the worst flight I had in US."
"Worst airline experience I've ever had. First flight broke down due to a broken fuel gauge. They made us drive 2 hours to the nearest airport to try to get on the next plane. We then sat in the next plane for over an hour after departure time. No communication from any staff in either experience. They denied passengers the chance to exit the delayed flight and refused to provide updates on any aspect of the flight. I would not wish this airline upon my worst enemy."
"Spirit Airlines is absolutely the worst airline. They switched my leaving times from Cancun 2 to 3 times then they delayed our flight 2-3 times when we had a 7 hour layover in Orlando. Then last minute switched our gate all the way over to the complete opposite side. I warn every person that is going to another state do not use Spirit airlines in anyway shape or form or you will be left with nothing but the worst experience and disappointment. Do not use This company. I paid for WiFi and they did not have WiFi available on either plane ride. Now I’m filling out forms to be reimbursed. "
"Our return flight got moved at least 4 times. Then we thought it was only delayed a couple hours but instead it was actually pushed up almost 24 hours so when we arrived at the airport we had missed our flight. We had to pay an extra $99 a person to get on the next flight (almost leaving the same time as or original flight so why was our flight changed?). I called the next day to complain and was told there was nothing they could do because we already paid the money - apparently they wanted us to be stuck in an airport instead and I couldn’t speak to a real person and needed to email customer support. Needless to say, customer support said too bad and offered zero assistance. Not to mention the plane on our flight home had ZERO room and sounded like it could fall out of the sky at any moment. Never flying Spirit again."
"I will never travel with Spirit again! There staff is untrained, unprofessional and it shows in their work. I've never had a problem with this airline until my last trip and they really ruined it for me. Not only do you have to put up with cramped seating, over priced snacks, they went above and beyond with completely ruining my luggage! Lied to me about there policy! Didn't care to help find or credit for a room after they were the reason we missed our connecting flight, and we paid for insurance!"
"Absolutely terrible! Delayed our flight home by 2 hours. While arriving at baggage drop one hour and 45 min before departure, they refused to take our luggage and told us our flight was now leaving on time! We were told we could be switched to a flight that would be leaving in 2 days (ridiculous)! I in turn had to buy new tickets home that cost me $1,600! Now they are telling me that reimbursement is not an option because the flight was delayed due to weather conditions? We were never told of these weather conditions and the weather was beautiful!"
"For almost 1 year I have been trying to obtain the cash refund as required by regulation for a cancelled flight. Never mind that after being delayed 5 hours due to weather and ultimately being on the aircraft only to be cancelled, the flight was still cancelled. The pilot apologized so many times - he was great. He said Spirit will try to tell us it is weather, but the weather had cleared hours earlier. The issue was no co-pilot, so at 2AM we drove 3 hours home and missed a wedding and had a bunch of unrefunable hotels. So why the issue with Spirit? A cancelled flight = refund. Not if you use a Visa Gift Card to pay. ""We can only refund to the form of payment used to purchase the ticket."" So, that's it? Because I paid ""wrong"" Spirit holds on to $574 and never has to return it? I have chatted, called, emailed and sent written letters. No response on the letters. Chat can't do anything. Email just says what the chat people say. The FAA has had this for almost 1 year. Lesson learned. Do not fly Spirit. They quite literally have stolen from me."
"Before flying I did my homework on this airline and was terrified because everything I read was horrible. After flying with this airline. I disagree on most things. First, the flight was great. The flight attendants were very nice, I felt well informed. Everything was on time. Now snack and drinks were expensive so on that side I agree with the reviews. The Wi-Fi was also rather expensive but those are minor things on a 4 hour flight. I brought my own snacks and had a movie downloaded. The seats are very small but I’m a big guy and was comfortable. So all in all I would totally fly Spirit again"
"Check in people for Spirit were the rudest people I have ever talked to. This was the worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with in my life. There were 2 agents and they both gave attitude when my friend asked for her plane ticket to be printed. I had printed my ticket at the kiosk so I thought, and when I got to security they told me it was just a receipt. I ran back upstairs and I asked if the kiosk even printed plane tickets and they said no. They let me leave knowing I didn’t have a plane ticket and told me I was going to miss my flight. They said it was my fault and I should have gone to them instead. The lady refused to print my ticket and folded her arms while she mocked me and proceeded to tell me she wasn’t going to print out my ticket and she was going to make me miss my flight. This entire time she kept rolling her eyes and laughing at me. I had to make it to Vegas for a funeral and I let her know I needed to make it and I could make it if she released the ticket and she refused until I had to literally beg, multiple times. While she was telling me I was for sure going to miss my flight, our flight wasn’t scheduled to take off for another hour. We sprinted through the airport and made it with 30 minutes to spare."
"Worst company in the world! I took a family trip and bought the tickets 3 months in advance, I also bought the seats. On the day of travel they will cancel the flight without any explanation. I needed to buy a ticket on another airline that enabled us to reach the destination, I lost $1000. On the way back, we had another problem with a long line to check in our luggage."
"eI gave my KTN number when I booked my ticket. It didn’t show up on my boarding pass. I spent 4 hours on there chat and they kept passing me onto other agents. No one would create a new boarding pass for me. They finally ended my chat with no resolution. Horrible customer service"
"Attendants are rude and unprofessional. They are also unable to communicate with passengers effectively. The airline also should be blamed for trying to cheat paying passengers by asking us to pay for carryon that won't fit into the crate. If it has a wheel of course it won't fit. When I turned it upside down it fitted but, our rude attendants stated it has to be side ways. If you don't want to pay take off the wheel or make it fit into the crate. I am just an employee following policy and the messenger. You can take your complaint to the corporate. The entire experience was a nightmare of paying additional $237 at the counter for carryon after only paying $80 for 2 big checked in bags."
"The gate agent, Jessica was first class. Very warm and friendly. You can tell she enjoys her job and interacts very well with passengers and fellow workers. I'd give her a huge raise if I were you."
"Flight ended up costing 5x what I originally paid due to my connecting flight being cancelled after a six hour delay. The plane was there but they didn't have a pilot to fly the plane. It was a Saturday night and Spirit informed me that my rescheduled flight would be on Wednesday (yes, 4 days later). My option was to be stranded in Las Vegas or find another flight. Spirit would not put me on another flight to Portland the next day (which was still a 3 hour drive from Seattle ending up costing me another $200), which meant another ticket. Total costs ended up being over $1,000 for what was originally about a $200 ticket. Spirit said they would refund me the fare from Las Vegas to Seattle which was less than $100, and they never did. I had to dispute that charge on my credit card. Never had an experience this bad in 30 years of traveling."
"Seats uncomfortable? Yes, definitely. Upgrading to exit row at least provided more leg room. Except flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Philadelphia, the exit seats have permanent armrests for each seat so you had to mold yourself into the seat which made it impossible to get comfortable. Only complaint about customer service is their definition of ""normal wear and tear"" on damaged luggage. One of the casters on my spinner suitcase (4 casters) was completely destroyed and broken off during the flight. Filed a claim through the website (which was very simple). However, response was that destroying the caster making the spinner suitcase totally useless was ""normal wear and tear"". The worst part is that there is no way to communicate back regarding the incident to ask for explanation or refute their conclusion. They are a cheap airline in every sense of the word."
"Both flights were late, employees were rude while rushing to board. No seat room, minimal padding in seats, and they charge you for water. They tout that they’re on time instead of being honest about being late."
"My flight got ""diverted"" while I was in MID AIR due to a ""delay in weather"" coming from Fort Lauderdale, which I'm reading more and more now that it was due to not enough pilots to fly the plane. My flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta was originally scheduled at 1:35, which got pushed back to nearly 3:30. The return flight to Cleveland was 5:35. I was in the plane at 5:45 due to ""over head traffic"". Once I started growing concern about missing my flight, I then asked the flight attendants for help, her response was snarly and rudely stated "" you need to contact customer service or email them."" While still on the flight. Sprit then rebooked my flight for the following morning for free, thank you for that. I then stayed in the airport from 6pm-4am without being offered a hotel voucher. I wake up at 4:30 to check my bag only to be told I needed to pay an additional $89 for a bag that was already checked, twice for a total of $135. The first lady I encountered at the Atlanta airport Spirit help desk was extremely rude, and once I told her I already paid for the bag, she asked for aid from the supervisor with a nasty attitude. The manager walked over and simply said ""we don't see anything here, you need to pay $89 and then walked away."" After trying to show her that I paid TWICE for the bags from my bank accounts, she snapped and responded ""I don't care about that, it will be $89."" I asked to speak to her boss where she told me to contact customer service. As I walk out of the line on the phone, the other staff whispered under her voice ""get your ass out of here."" I got on the phone with the manager,  who then proceeded to tell me that since I booked through a 3rd party site and the ""weather"" there was nothing they could do. I stated that she was going to lose a customer and her response was ""we can not change the policy."" Unapologetic, nasty, and very unwelcoming was every single employee from that airline minus the gentlemen helping the kiosk area. The man was really nice and helpful with a great attitude. I will never fly this airline again, the employees are rude, demeaning and have no solutions to any of the questions that I had. This was the worst travel experience I've ever had, not because of the change in flights, but the customer service. Never again will Spirit Airlines receive another penny from a loyal customer who has been flying Spirit for years."
"There were six canceled flights the same day mine was. I talked to one of the Spirit employees and they said that my cancellation was because flight attendants and pilots just weren’t showing up so they’re LYING and saying it’s weather so they don’t have to compensate people. I was rebooked and didn’t get the email until an hour after the flight left! They weren’t even going to rebook me because they said I missed my flight. I was then stranded in a connecting city with no food or hotel vouchers. I will NEVER fly with Spirit again."
"First they said they’d be 1.5 hours delayed so my son got to the airport only to find out they left on time. He missed it and I had to buy another ticket through Delta so he wouldn’t miss out connecting flight to Cancun. On the way back his return flight was cancelled due to Spirit because they said if he misses the first flight the entire trip is void. Never heard that before. All in all this company used to be decent and now is a complete scam. "
"The worst. By the time I finished my flight it cost me almost $500 round trip. On my way home my bag was over weight. 44.5 lbs. That cost $80 additionally after I had already Paid $62 for that bag. Seats are like a wood bench no cushion. The women at the ticket counter who was very staunch about that extra 4lbs. Was also at the gate nailing everyone for extra money if their bag was 1 inch too big. Here is the sneaky thing about Spirit there carry on bag size is smaller then most other airlines. They are guaranteed that extra $100 for an oversized carry on. If you believe you are getting a good deal and want to keep the price point you were sold. Don't bring a bag. Sleazy, shady operation. Never again you lost a many customers today I watched all the people being penalized like me turn ghost white at the fees. I told all of them, (about a dozen or more) you must write a review. Again sleazy business practices. Spirit will never ever get another dollar from me. I will walk to Florida."
"Terrible airline. I have had issues several times but the icing on Today was they called me notifying me that my baggage wouldn't arrive until 8 hours after me at my destination because I didn't re check it.  I asked if I had to re check before boarding and was told no. The airport is an hour from where I'm going."
"Will never fly Spirit again. No one should. Flight delayed so long that my wife and I missed our connecting flight. Given the option of refund or flight 27 hours later. Treated rudely and with no compassion when asked for hotel or food vouchers. Staff at every point: in flight, at gate, at ticket counter, etc. Rude, bordering on abusive. Gouging everyone on luggage and carry on, even personal items. ""We're saying it was the weather"" was one response. Something needs to be done about this airline. I can only hope with all the complaints, Something will be done. They are simply horrible."
"I flew with Spirit 5 years ago but had no choice but to fly a few days ago. First I flew from DFW to Orlando, which the flight was extremely delayed (not due to weather.). I got to Orlando and the flight had departed already in mid-flight. I had to wait in the customer service line at the airport with 2 grumpy hungry kids one being an infant. I waited for almost 3 hours. When it was time to find a new flight they said they wouldn’t be able to book us until 2 days later because their flights were full. So the lady booked us with another airline (just as bad) I had to repay for my suitcases, which their suitcase charges are out of this world. Anyway long story short I called to get a refund and the lady on the phone was rude and didn’t know what her job was obviously. She told me that it was considered a no show so she can’t help me . I repeated myself numerous of times asking her to clarify how that was considered a no show because I didn’t fly from DFW to Florida on my own. She didn’t know what to say and just said this was part of our guidelines and policy. I told her to show me and she kept repeating the same thing over and over again. Yet going no where once again. I got extremely frustrated and I told her I wanted to speak to a manager she said there were almost 600 callers in queue so the wait was long. At this point I waited 4 hours to speak to someone so I thought what the heck another 4 hours. She hung up on me. Told me she couldn’t transfer me because I was speaking to my mom and telling her the case. Spirit is a scam and makes takes your money. "
"Don't do it! Cheap is no good if they take you half way, cancel your return flight with no explanation, then offer your either and only half your cheap ticket price refund, or wait two days for a return flight. So stuck with buying expensive one way ticket home. (Also, could never reach customer service.) Never again on Spirit. Read the reviews and believe them - they suck."
"Worst airline ever. Delay after delay after delay, don't plan anything on the day you are flying in or out, you will be stuck for hours. Very inconvenient. Pay the extra money for better flights. Your time is valuable."
"You get what you pay for. No consideration for continuous delays, up to where I miss a connection, arrive the next day vs. day planned and choose to switch airlines so I can feel confident I'll make it home. Carry on for $89 each way. No complimentary beverage (including water) and no entertainment for long flights without buying a plan. The best things are seat comfort. Skip this airline."
"This is the worst airline ever, very bad customer service from the gate personnel. They were yelling to people and don’t help anybody. Both the lady and the man. They have different policy from the coming flight other than the going flight regarding the personal item. Flight delays all the time. Not only me but everyone is complaining. The only thing I know is I am not using this airline again ever."
"Absolute worst airline in the world. They canceled a flight at 12:30 at night while most people are sleeping. They say it’s because of bad weather, you look at a weather map and it’s supposed to be one of the sunniest days. They also don’t give a refund for them canceling your flight and trying to switch over to another airline. Absolute worst airline I can’t wait until it doesn’t exist anymore."
"I will never fly Spirit again. They took $300 that did not belong to them and refused to give it back. The majority of workers are rude and don't treat humans like human beings. They just see you as a ticket that they can get money out of. You may have a more successful business if you took a page from Delta airlines."
"Short story to a really rough 4 days. Lost our luggage, staff at the reno/Tahoe airport was no help, didn't have bags for 2 days, was told the bag would be delivered to us, we had to drive to airport find someone with delta airlines to help us, got our bags, contacted us and said they had our bags (which they didnt) rude as hell. To add to the horrible experience already. Flying home they charged us an extra 125 dollars for luggage that we already paid for. When flying out I asked the agent to check to see if my luggage was on the plane and she refused with a smile on her face. I have a feeling my luggage will never make it to my destination. It may seem cheaper at 1st but they nickle and dime you the whole time!!! "
"Literally the cheapest and worst airline for a reason. You're better off paying a little extra for another airline. They charge for everything, it ends up being more expensive. At least others include luggage, snacks and friendly staff. They just have a bad attitude."
"I arrived 4 hours before my flight and all flights that were boarding were overbooked by Spirit so you had families and couples not able to get on the plane when they arrived 10 minutes before their flight took off as it was overbooked but spirit claimed the gates already closed to the customer. One passenger later on was upset and a spirit employee screamed back at him that if he doesn’t stop talking that she will cancel his flight and she then screamed cancelled, you don’t have a flight! Bye! For my flight - it was overbooked - and they only allowed 77 people who were booked for this flight to board (luckily I was one). Then in line to board we found out people have been stuck at Orlando airport since Wednesday and Friday trying to get home (it was Sunday now). Some said Spirit ran out of vouchers so they had to pay for transport, hotel and food out of pocket since Wednesday. One person said they wouldn’t reimburse all the upgrades she paid for on her previous flight (buying a big seat option and now she was out of luck and booked in a regular seat). These people were let on our flight to Columbus but the remaining people that were supposed to be flying to Columbus on Sunday who knows how long they were stuck at Orlando and how much extra money they spent on hotel and meals to return to the airport to find out they were still stuck in Orlando for another 2-3 days possibly? Seeing all of this really scared me to fly with Spirit again - tickets are the cheapest right now (probably because people don’t want to fly with them again) but to find out you won’t be going home for another 2-4 days and Spirit ran out of any vouchers and won’t compensate you being delayed. I got lucky this time but you’re rolling the dice every time you fly with spirit there is no security you will board your flight nor any idea when you’ll be able to get back home - booking a flight is not a reservation but an option bookmark that doesn’t guarantee you a flight at Spirit."
"  I stopped flying Spirit for 8 years since we had a very bad experience. 8 years later making the same mistake, what a terrible experience what a horrible staff, our flight got Cancelled and nothing they left us at the airport till next day, what a horrible experience"
"This is the worst experience of my life. My children and I have endured two tail swaps today and have been sitting in the airport for now 12 hours and are still currently waiting. There is no back up plan. There are no updates from the staff. We were issued a meal voucher than cannot even he used in flight. I will never recommend this airline to anyone."
"Worst airline ever. Recommend spending more and get a decent airline. Harassed by the lady on the counter for baggage size which was much smaller than recommended size"
"Tried to cancel flight due to COVID. Instead spent more than a day trying to contact them and over 5 hours over the phone. Then they want me to pay a $119 cancelation fee? This company treats its customers like absolute garbage. To get my boarding pass I had to download their app that was loaded with trackers, and I could not even use it to cancel the flight. Good to see that they don't care about their customers. I will never fly with them."
"Delayed for one hour due to replacing a tire that they have all night to do so, but they waited until last minute. People cut off check in line and customer service does nothing to them, when I ask for a supervisor they say we don’t have any go complain online. The worst airline, never again."
"Do not fly Spirit Airlines. They cancelled my flight twice causing an absolute disruption in my work schedule, and causing me to incur expenses associated with hotel/taxi/tours cancellations as well ruining my paid time off balance at work. Next time I'll go to a different airline and pay a few hundred extra knowing that the trip will actually happen. I've traveled a lot in my life and have never seen such poor business as Spirit Airlines. I do not recommend Spirit Airlines to anyone. I don't know how they are still staying in business. I wish I could give a zero star."
"Don't fly Spirit Airlines! My wife and I were to fly from Austin, TX to Fort Lauderdale to join a cruise ship. We were leaving a day early in case of any problems. Forty-five minutes before our flight was to leave, Spirit canceled the flight. They said weather was the cause. No effort to rebook us, but told your canceled and here is your money back: it's your problem. At this late booking time, it cost us $4,000 to catch our cruise ship in Bermuda."
"  My flight was in April. They did cancel it less than 2 hours before flying I called them they confirmed the cancellation and they want me to pay $500 extra to go on the second flight which almost 45 m after my actual one. So I have to book with a different airline from my own pocket. I can not find any help from them. My feeling was that they try to take as much money as they can from me It happens with me before, It is not the first time. It is the worst airline that I know. "
"Never fly this airline. Lost my bag and haven’t been able to forward it to my destination for over 1.5 days now. Terrible service via phone giving me a response if we can’t help you, you should go back to the airport and talk to the spirit desk there. Pretty sure I’ve just lost a $300 suitcase and $600 + of clothing. Who knows though, perhaps it will show up in a month and I can just go shopping for new clothes tomorrow. "
"Don't do it. I've flown a lot and Spirit is awful, never been so upset traveling. Our flight was canceled last minute, had to wait a full 24 hours to get to our destination and were not given a hotel or anything. Then we finally get to our destination and one of our checked bags was not put on the plane so now we're delayed even further trying to find our bag. Also all staff we experienced was rude and unhelpful. Never flying Spirit again."
"Do not fly with this airline, they are cheap but will not get you to your destination on time. They change flights, don’t notify the customers while there sitting and just plan lazy and not dependable. I’ve flown from Newark to Dallas thinking the next time it will be better always the same , going to Newark from Dallas, Atlanta or Cleveland they are not dependable and your flight will be delayed at least twice. If you have to meet a specific time, do not go with Spirit or Frontier."
"Please, please and please people, do not book this flight. They cancelled a flight at the eleventh hour and my wife and two year old son were stuck at Las Vegas. We had to book another flight with a different airline before they could reach their destination. Do not work with them, they’re not truthful"
"Worst airline. Tried to charge personal items at the boarding gate. In our case, they let us go at Seattle airport, then they force us to pay at Houston airport for the same size personal item! When we refused to pay, they cancel our flight. We refused to pay because it does not make any sense to us. Why they let us go from one gate and dont let us go at the other gate? We are now left in the airport waiting for next flight 2 days later if we want to fly together (6 of us). So frustrated and upset!"
"They changed our flight like 8 times then canceled our flight an hour beforehand. We were supposed to leave Saturday and they said they didn’t have a flight until Monday. We had to cancel our flight then rebook with a different airline altogether. Paying an extra $400 per person. They blamed it on the department of transportation even though they were aware a month in advance of the projects that were being worked on. So there was “nothing they could do about it”."
"This is the absolute worst airline experience I've ever had. From outrageous charges for rescheduling our flights to a 4 and a half hour delay on our layover. None of our group will be flying Spirit ever again and we will be reaching out for compensation for the hassle we've been put through. "
"Never make the mistake of flying with Spirit, however attractive their price may appear. I booked with them only because their prices seemed low but was thoroughly deceived. They are least bothered about customers and cancel flights."
"Don't ever use Spirit Airlines! I should have known better with how ""cheap"" their flights are but this is ridiculous. Our flight just got canceled after 6 hours of it being delayed several times along with gate changes which were never announced. Now we have to get a hotel room for $250 just so we don't have to sleep on the airport floor. And Spirit's answer is ""We don't have to reimburse you or give you food vouchers because it's 'weather-related'. Our beachfront hotel in South Beach didn't cost that much. I could have spent that money and had a whole extra beach day and not spent all day in the airport! Amazing how the government has no rules and regulations to stop us from being treated this way. Not only am I out an entire day of vacation, I lost a day of work, along with all the extra baggage fees and overage fees (they only allow bags up to 40lbs and not 50). The customer service is appalling. I could go on and on but am too angry right now to relive this whole ordeal. Just don't fly with them. It's not worth it to save a few bucks. You're not really saving anyway once you pay for your seats and carry-on and checked in luggage. Worst airline ever along with Frontier."
"It was the worst experience ever. Do not travel with this airline in any case. I had an important life event in New Jersey. I had booked a flight 5:28AM departure in morning from Austin and it got cancelled the morning I reached to airport 3:00 AM in the morning when I went to counter there were no flights that would let me attend the life event that I booked my flight for. The Mental pressure, stress and inconvenience that it caused was just immense. It is not worth it. Pay extra for some other airline but don't risk that emotional distress with this airline"
"The flight was ok, had to upgrade seat because their seats are very small and when I arrived at my destination and got my check bag (which was a brand new leather garment bag) the leather at the handle is ripped open, my TSA lock is gone and Spirit say this is normal wear on luggage. This was the first trip taken with this luggage and they say they will not replace it. Don't fly with them."
"This is the absolute worst airline. The staff are rude and have attitudes, their flights are delayed or canceled and they are constantly trying to charge you for anything they can. They don’t show care or appreciation to their customers and just want to be greedy I don’t appreciate this airline at all nor respect it. They will never get my money again and I will never recommend to someone. "
"Worst airline ever! Small seats, zero legroom( I'm 5'3""), no free water. Delayed and baggage tag wouldn't print either way. Extremely long lines. Rude customer service. Charge for everything! Fly Southest to Vegas."
"Our returning flight was delayed 8 hours and we were not given any update. They gave us a update 2 hrs before the flight came, they gave us a different plane with no oversized seats after I payed for it but still tried to charge me. I ended up getting a voucher for $100 and just tried to use it for a flight and they told me I can only use $7 because the base Fair is only $7 but I can find a more expensive flight so I can use the $100. I will never fly this horrible airlins with horrible customer service."
"For $20 cheaper ticket I ended up paying $200 extra for one luggage and 1 carry-on. I will never touch this airline again. I paid another $200 extra on my return too with huge long delays on both flights."
"Ticket was originally purchased from Cancun to Houston, airline then changed to Cancun to Ft. Lauderdale and Ft. Lauderdale to Houston. Not an issue but was rather upset I now had to buy an extra pair of seats. I purchased seats and bags for $311.20. Fast forward to last week, Ft. Lauderdale airport was closed due to recent flooding, so I changed back to my original flight. Apparently that flight was more expensive so I was not able to get a refund on my seats. Why in the world would spirit send me multiple emails to pre-purchase seats and bags? I spent an hour on hold for them to tell me that my original flight was more expensive. If this was the case, then why did they not reimburse me for the difference when they changed it to Ft. Lauderdale? I will never use Spirit and will never recommend it to anyone. Staff and attendants were extremely friendly and helpful. I will give credit where credit is due. I purchased the streaming wifi and it only worked for 1.5 hours of my trip. extremely frustrating."
"We had a five day vacation to Dominican Republic scheduled. Our return flight home was OK, but the the flight there was put off by so many hours that we would have missed our connection flight in Fort Lauderdale. We had to buy very expensive tickets on another airline in order to get to our fully inclusive resort on time. Because of the travel delay we were given $200 (4 @ $50) vouchers for future travel with Spirit Airlines to be used by May 27. I have tried 4 times to use my vouchers. I changed dates, I changed times, but could not get the Spirit Web site to accept the vouchers. I read all the restrictions and set my dates accordingly, but no luck. I spent 5 hours today online with Spirit Chat only to be abruptly disconnected at the end. Three people actually chatted with me during this time and acted like they were going to help, but nothing happened. I now have vouchers that are useless. I wasted hours of my time, did not get help. They do not care at all about customers! I will not fly with Spirit again."
"Just about to board and they pulled me out of the line and demanded I pay $198.00 for my bag and my GF's Bag. I have flown my whole life and have never been robbed like this. I have carried on my bag every single flight all my life. On the flight there was gum stuck to the tray table. Adelay in Ft. Lauderdale kept us in the airport for 14 hours. Yes not in their control, but the ticket agent say too bad we can't help you get onto another flight. I had to demand a supervisor to get on standby. Why did I have to demand a supervisor from this agent to help me get on a flight the next morning? This airline is the worst experience I have ever had and I will never fly them again. "
"This was the worst flying experience I’ve ever had. It started with the excessive baggage fees of $70 per bag, and it only got worse after we checked in these bags and we went to board our connecting flight. Mind you we had no issue flying San Antonio Texas to Vegas but once we left Vegas to fly to Burbank, this horrible woman started pulling everyone out of the line literally talking to us like we were cattle and told us we had too many bags when we each that they allowed us to bring on the first flight but not the second they made us wait in line and literally pay 100 extra dollars per bag. It was horrendous so my friend and I ended up paying $400 extra dollars for bags when there was plenty of room on the aircraft, and it was only at the last minute when this woman started singling out people. The excessive fees were bad enough, but her attitude was unspeakable. We ordered coffee and a container of pretzels, and when they sat them down on the tray, they told us the fee for each person was $18 to which we said take it back. Horrible experience."
